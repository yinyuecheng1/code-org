## Overview ng Lesson

Ang pinaka-ugat ng lahat computer science ay tinatawag na algorithm. Ang salitang "algorithm" ay medyo komplikado pakinggan, pero sa totoo ay ito lamang ay isang listahan ng mga instruction na sinusunod upang makakuha ng resulta. Upang makapagbigay ng matatag na basehan para sa edukasyon ng iyong mga estudyante sa computer science, bibigyan nating kahalagahan kung paano gamitin ang mga algorithm.

## Layunin ng Leksiyon

### Ang estudyante ay:

  * Maglilista ng mga hakbang upang pagalawin ang tauhan sa loob ng map
  * Ayusin ang mga direksyon upang makarating sa pangunahing goal
  * Mahulaan kung saan pupunta ang tauhan, sa pamamagitan ng mga listahan ng hakbang na ibinigay

## Pagsisimula (10 min)

### <a name="Vocab"></a> 1) Vocabulary

Ang lesson na ito ay meron isang bago at importante na salita:  


[centerIt]

![](vocab.png)

[/centerIt]

**Algorithm** - Bigkasin natin: Al-go-ri-thm   
Isang listahan ng mga hakbang upang matapos ang gawain.

### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 2) Step-by-Step

  * Tanungin ang iyong mga estudyante ng mga direksyon papunta ng chalkboard. 
      * Kung sila ay magbigay ng instruction ng sabay-sabay, sabihin na maaari ka lamang sumunod sa instruction ng paisa-isa. Tawagin ng paisa-isa ang bawat estudyante kung ito ay makakatulong. 
  * Kapag narating mo na board, humingi ng mga instruction upang makaguhit ng nakangiti na mukha. 
      * Gaya ng dati, humingi ng instruction ng paisa-isa lang.
  * Ipaliwanag na maraming gawain ang kayang tapusin gamit ang ibat'-ibang lista ng mga instruction. Ito ang tinatawag na algorithm. 
  * Hamunin ang iyong mga estudyante na magkaisa at bumuo ng isang grupo upang makagawa ng mga algorithm para sa kanilang single-step at double-step na mga maze.

# Lesson Tip

Students can work in pairs to create the adventures, then work in pairs to solve the adventures of others. If this feels too chaotic you can work together as a class and create the adventure on a document camera, then work together to solve it.

## Activities: (20 min)

### <a name="Activity1"></a> 3) [Happy Maps: Single-Step Adventure](Activity1-HappyMaps.pdf)

  * This worksheet helps teach students how to think ahead in order to plan a short route from the Flurbâ€™s start location to the final location, just one square away.
  * Print out an activity packet for every group (ideally 2 to 4 students) and cut the Maps apart. Leave the arrow symbols for the students to cut apart.
  * Explain the rules to the class, making sure to emphasise the new word "algorithm."

> Flurbs are happy, fuzzy little things.
> 
> Flurbs love to eat fruit. Fruit is hard to find in Flurb Town. Use the maps to help the Flurb find some fruit.
> 
> Work with your group to decide which direction the Flurb needs to step to get to the fruit.

**Directions for Class:**

> 1) Cut out an arrow for each member of your team.

> 2) Start with Map 1 to help the Flurb look for fruit.

[/centerIt]

  
  


> 3) Have each member of your group put an arrow next to the map to vote for which way the Flurb should step.
> 
> 4) If not all arrows are pointing the same way, talk to each other and decide as a group which way the arrow should point.
> 
> 5) When your whole group agrees on a direction, your team can share your answer with the teacher.
> 
> 6) If your answer is correct, move on to the next map.

  
  


<!-- 
### <a name="Activity2"></a> 4) Double-Step Adventure
- The Double-Step sheet encourages students to take their knowledge just a little bit further as they find algorithms that will lead their Flurbs to their goal which is two or more steps away. 
-->

## Wrap-up (5 min)

### <a name="WrapUp"></a> 4) Flash Chat: What did we learn?

  * Did you feel like you were actually telling the Flurb what to do?
  * What would it be like to control a robot that way?
  * What would you create if it were that easy to tell a computer what to do?

[tip]

# Lesson Tip

Flash Chat questions are intended to spark big-picture thinking about how the lesson relates to the greater world and the students' greater future. Use your knowledge of your classroom to decide if you want to discuss these as a class, in groups, or with an elbow partner.

[/tip]

### <a name="Shmocab"></a> 5) Vocab Shmocab

  * Which one of these definitions did we learn a word for today?

> "Breaking something into exactly two pieces"   
> "A list of steps that you can follow to finish a task"   
> "The plastic coating on the end of a shoelace"  
> 
> 
> > ...and what is the word that we learned?

[/together]

## Assessment (10 min)

### <a name="Assessment"></a>6) [Move the Flurbs](/curriculum/course1/1/Assessment1-HappyMaps.pdf)

  * Hand out the worksheet titled "Move the Flurbs" and allow students to complete the activity independently after the instructions have been well explained.

## Extended Learning

Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Create Your Own

  * Allow the students to guide you toward solving a problem (that you provide) one step at a time. Point out that every time they make a step, the rest of the adventure gets easier. If the students are still excited by the exercise, give them a more complicated configuration to solve.

### Flurb Flash

  * Cycle quickly through single-step puzzles on your projector. Have the students hold up an arrow card or simply point in the direction that they think the Flurb should move.

## Step 1: Understand the Puzzle

  * What does the puzzle want you to do?

  * Hast du am Anfang einen Code bekommen? 
      * Wozu dient es?
      * Warum glaubst du, dass es dort ist?

  * If you start to get frustrated, take a deep breath, or leave your screen for a minute. When you come back, you may see what was causing the trouble!

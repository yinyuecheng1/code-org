# Unit 4: Lesson 4 - The Cost of Free

## Background

Why is so much of the stuff you use online free? Who is paying for it? Many people are unaware of how information about them is being collected and tracked by the technology they use every day. Often, you "pay" for it with your data. The maker of an app can use data they collect from you to make money, and provide you with a service or app for free. This carries some risks to your personal privacy and security. Most companies make great efforts to balance the tradeoffs between providing you with a useful service and protecting your privacy, but the issues can be tricky and raise confounding ethical dilemmas.

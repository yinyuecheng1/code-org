## Lesson Overview (Discovery)
This optional lesson can be used as a brief preview to the course on the first-day of class, when teachers typically have many classroom administrative tasks to accomplish, but also want to set the stage for the class. Students begin thinking about the influences of technology as they engage in a Think-Pair-Share strategy about the computing innovations that have impacted their lives.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 10 minutes

1) Class discussion: "What computing innovation has had the most impact on your life?"

### **Activity: Think-Pair-Share** - 10-20  minutes  
2) Think-Write-Pair-Share and/or discussion.   


### **Wrap-up** - 5  minutes 
3) Extend the learning beyond the classroom.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Select computing innovations.
- Explain the impacts of that innovation on their lives.
- Compare their answers to other students' answers.
- Engage adults in a discussion about the impact of technology.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
 - Writing Utensil, Paper

### For the Teacher
- Something to record and display students' ideas.


## Getting Started (10 min)
This short activity can be used after any required first-day administrative duties.

1) Class discussion:

- Innovation is an important theme of this course. Engage students in this theme by asking them to complete this sentence: "The computing innovation that has had the most impact on my life is ...., because ...."
- You may need to provide a context for the students by giving students examples of innovations.

# Teaching Tip
 Written communication is a important skill. This curriculum provides a variety of opportunities for students to develop the skills they will need to perform well in the various AP exam Performance Tasks. For activities in which students are asked to complete sentences, model a formal communication style using complete sentences.

[/tip]
  
## Activity: Think-Write-Pair-Share (10-20 min)
### 2) Engage students in a Think-Write-Pair-Share.   

- Allow students a few minutes to independently and silently think about and complete the sentence. Students then pair  with a nearby partner and take turns talking and listening to each other as they share their answers. 
- If there is time, join each student pair with another pair for a second round of sharing and discussion. A large-group class discussion can replace the second pair-share portion of the activity if it is more appropriate for the class setting or the time available.

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 3) Extend the learning beyond the classroom.

- Ask students to think about how the adults in their lives might answer the question, "What computing innovation has had the most impact on your life?" 
- Ask for a few volunteers to speculate on what they might hear and how the innovation changed lives. 
- Suggest that they ask a parent or other adult the question to learn more about the impacts of technical innovations of the past.

## Assessment Questions

- What do you think is required for some innovation to have a "significant impact" on your life? 
- Speculate on how students 25 years from now will answer, "What computing innovation has had a significant impact on your life?"

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In this lesson, students will expand their knowledge of sending messages to include electronic communication as they explore the technical aspects of the Internet, including IP addresses and DNS. In the "unplugged" activity, students act out the process of DNS servers and deliver messages according to IP addresses.

___

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will... 

- Explain the role of DNS servers.
- Describe how IP addresses are mapped to URLs.


# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal 
- Items provided by the teacher


### For the Teacher
- Gather these items:
 - Containers such as bags or bins 
 - Marker to number the containers
 - Tokens - about 3 per student
 - A list of the students in the classroom
 - A list of the students in the classroom for each table/team. If some students are absent, their names can be kept on the list. 


## **Getting Started** (10 min)
### 1)  Recall previous knowledge with Think-Write-Pair-Share.
- Form teams of 3-4 students each.
- Instruct students to answer these questions in their journals and then share with an elbow partner. 
  - What do you know about IP addresses? 
  - What do you know about URLs? 
  - What do you think is the relationship between the two?
- While the students are writing in their journals, set up the classroom by placing at each table: a marker and a container for each student and a list of student names for the table to share.


## **Activity: DNS Servers and IP Addresses** (35 min)  
### 2)  Locate recipients and send messages

- Set up the Activity
  - Ask each student to write a seven-digit whole number (not decimal) on his container. (Writing seven digits will likely ensure that no two numbers are the same.)
  - Ask one student at each table to record the number of each student at that table on the class list. 
  - Collect the containers and place them in a line (in any order) away from the students.
  - Assign one student at each table to the role of "seeker." 
  -  Ask each student (except the seeker) to choose 3 students from the class list that she does not know well to send a "message" to and record those names in her journal.  
- Start the Activity 
 - Each seeker takes one name request from the table, finds the table at which the requested person is sitting, requests that person's container number, and reports it back to the student who requested it. These numbers should be recorded on the class list and in the student journal next to the name. 
   - If a seeker does not know the individual she is seeking, she must at ask around until the individual is located.
   - Seekers should repeat the following sequence of steps as quickly as possible until all of the requests are satisfied: find the numbers, report back to their tables, and ask for another name to search for.  

- During the Activity:

 - Assign another individual to the seeker role once or twice.
 - Check on  each table to keep things moving along.
 - Work to ensure that every student is involved.
 - Monitor the time.

- Stopping the search and sending "messages"
   - After everyone has had a chance to request at least two  numbers, ask the students to stop.
   - Place 2-3 tokens for each student on each table.
   - Instruct students to place tokens in the numbered containers, one for each of the names they wrote in their journals.
   - To keep things organized, you may want to allow one table to go at a time.


## **Wrap-up** (5 min)
### 3) Reflect on student learning.
Instruct students to reflect on the activity in their journals, in a class discussion, or with their teammates.

- In terms of this activity, explain the role of DNS servers.
- In terms of this activity, describe how IP addresses are mapped to URLs.
- Analyze the experience of using containers to send messages:
 - What were the flaws in this system? 
 - How would you fix them? 


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Find Your IP Address

- Find the IP address of your computer by entering a search on your browser.
- Find the IP address of your mobile device by looking in the settings. 

### Find Your DNS Server

- How do you find your DNS server? Research this topic. Write a paragraph about what you learned as a mini-report and prepare to explain it to the class. 

### Research DNS Spoofing

- What is DNS spoofing? Research this topic and prepare to explain it to the class. Be sure to describe the problems that can arise and prevention strategies.

## Assessment Questions
- What is the role of a DNS server? 
- Why do we need both IP addresses and URLs?

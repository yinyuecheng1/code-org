title: Performance Task -  Investigate
description: "Earlier versions of the AP CSP Framework from The College Board included a Performance Task entitled 'Investigate: Bits to Information to Knowledge.' While this task is no longer required for submission, the activity provides a collaborative, creative way for students to demonstrate their understanding of data. This lesson will take at least 5 days (250 minutes) of class time. This lesson is optional, and it may be used as an assessment. Following the steps of a Performance Task on the topic of data will help students meet the Learning Objectives related to data and provide planning, writing, analytic, and data visualization skill practice for the AP CSP Performance Tasks on other topics and the related performance task modeling at the end of Units 5 and 6 in this curriculum package."

## Lesson Overview (Assessment)
Earlier versions of the AP CSP Framework from The College Board included a Performance Task entitled 'Investigate: Bits to Information to Knowledge.' While this task is no longer required for submission, the activity provides a collaborative, creative way for students to demonstrate their understanding of data. This lesson will take at least 5 days (250 minutes) of class time. This lesson is optional, and it may be used as an assessment. Following the steps of a Performance Task on the topic of data will help students meet the Learning Objectives related to data and provide planning, writing, analytic, and data visualization skill practice for the AP CSP Performance Tasks on other topics and the related performance task modeling at the end of Units 5 and 6 in this curriculum package.

## Activity: Data Investigation (250 min)
### 1) Performance task modeling activity.
- The College Board determined that a Performance Task  related to data will not be scored as part of the AP CSP exam. However, it is a useful exercise for students to complete this activity, both to demonstrate mastery of the Learning Objectives and to practice planning, writing, analytic, and data visualization skills for other Performance Tasks. 
- Follow the directions on the InvestigatePT2013.pdf document.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Reflection on the Task

- In your journal, reflect on this lesson and the skills you used (planning, writing, analytic, data visualization). Describe your skills before this project. How have your skills grown? What evidence do you have? What skills do you need more practice with.

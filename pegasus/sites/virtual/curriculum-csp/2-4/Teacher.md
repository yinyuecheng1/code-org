## Lesson Overview (Discovery)

In this lesson, students will clarify (and try to simplify) a language for sorting by using an online Code.org widget to refine their algorithm and ensure its correctness. They will also analyze the various student created algorithms in an attempt to determine which is "best".

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- Access to the web for using sorting widget [resouces/cardSort_byHand   Built with Processing and Processing.js.htm](resouces/cardSort_byHand   Built with Processing and Processing.js.htm)

### For the Teacher
- Video (in production): How we measure algorithms: what's counted and why.


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1)  Journal: How can we sort things that aren't numbers?
- Prompt students with this preface:
"So far you have been sorting playing cards which are a substitute for numbers.  A few lessons ago we talked about Google and the need to sort information in order to search through it. How do you think Google sorts web pages?  How would you sort other kinds of information such as people? Books? Images? Movies?  In order to sort any type of information, what must be true? What must you be able to do with it?"
- Collect the homework assignment from lesson 4 (sorting algorithms).

# Teaching Tip
Emphasize that in order to sort information there must be some basis of comparison. For example, Google might sort web pages based solely on the page's title.  Or maybe they also sort based on how popular the page is. You might sort images by the average color contained in it, or by a set of image tags. The problem of developing a basis of comparison for complex information is not trivial.

# Teaching Tip
Another truth  is that in order to sort things that aren't numbers, you must find a way to turn it into a number. This must be true since all digital information is stored in binary, and a computer's processor can only compare numbers. People have devised very clever ways to turn information into numbers - this is a reference to Unit 1 in which students did just that.

## Activity: Card Sorting Widget (20  min)  
### 2. Use card sorting widget to test/measure algorithms.
- Introduce students to the Code.org card sorting widget [resouces/cardSort_byHand   Built with Processing and Processing.js.htm](resouces/cardSort_byHand   Built with Processing and Processing.js.htm)
- Instruct students explore the widget to figure out how it functions and what it is counting as "work."
- Guide students to use the widget with their sorting algorithm and to record the results.


## Activity: Measuring algorithms (15 min)

## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives

- 4.1.1 Develop an algorithm for implementation in a program. [P2]  
- 4.1.1A Sequencing, selection, and iteration are building blocks of algorithms.  
- 4.1.1G Knowledge of standard algorithms can help in constructing new algorithms.   - 4.1.1H Different algorithms can be developed to solve the same problem.   - 4.1.1J Developing a new algorithm to solve a problem can yield insight into the problem.  
- 4.1.2 Express an algorithm in a language. [P5]  
- 4.1.2A Languages for algorithms include natural language, pseudocode, and visual and textual programming languages.   - 4.1.2B Natural language and pseudocode describe algorithms so that humans can understand them.   
- 4.1.2F The language used to express an algorithm can affect characteristics such as clarity or readability but not whether an algorithmic solution exists.  
- 4.1.2I Clarity and readability are important considerations when expressing an algorithm in a language.

title: Sending a Word with Bits
description: " In this lesson, students will face two challenges in using their bit-sending machines to communicate a message. The first challenge is to convert and send a single alphabetic letter using the device. The second challenge is to send a word. Both of these tasks have several inherent problems to overcome and require students to use abstraction to decompose the problem into smaller, more easily solved tasks. Effective collaboration is an important objective in this lesson also; they will have their first experience in a small joint writing project which is a preview to requirements in the AP Performance Tasks.

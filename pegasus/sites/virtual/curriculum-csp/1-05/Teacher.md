## Lesson Overview (Creative)
In this lesson, students will face two challenges in using their bit-sending machines to communicate a message. The first challenge is to convert and send a single alphabetic letter using the device. The second challenge is to send a word. Both of these tasks have several inherent problems to overcome and require students to use abstraction to decompose the problem into smaller, more easily solved tasks. Effective collaboration is an important objective in this lesson also; they will have their first experience in a small joint writing project which is a preview to requirements in the AP Performance Tasks.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 5 minutes
1) Think-Pair-Share-Write. How would you send a word using your bit-sending device? 

### **Activity: Send an Alphabetic Letter** - 15 minutes  
2) Turn letters into bits.

### **Activity: From Letters to Words** - 15  minutes  
3) Send a stream of letters.

###  **Wrap-up** - 10  minutes 
4) Reflect on student learning.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Create a system to turn letters into bits.
- Analyze the problems associated with sending words.
- Create a system to send words using a bit-sending device.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student

- Journal
- The bit-sending device created in Lesson 2


### For the Teacher
- Provide access to the devices created earlier in the unit.

## **Getting Started** (5 min)
### 1) Think-Pair-Share-Write.

- Pose these questions for students to think about and then share with their teammate: How would you send a word using your bit-sending device? What problems must you solve first? 
- After students have discussed the problem with their partners, instruct then to collaborate in writing an answer in their journals that reflects the ideas of both members of the team.

## **Activity: Send an Alphabetic Letter** (20  min)  
### 2) Turn letters into bits.

-  Pose the challenge of sending words using the student-created bit-sending devices. 
- Instruct students to work in collaboration with their partners to devise a system for represent letters with bits.
- Give the students a few minutes to think.
- In a short class discussion, engage them to describe  their ideas for a system to send words with bits using their devices. 

## **Activity: From Letters to Words** (15 min)  
### 3) Send a stream of letters.

-  After the students have successfully solved the problem of sending a letter, present them with the challenge of sending a complete word.
-  Ask them to consider how the receiver will know that one word has ended and another has started if they are sending a multi-word message.
-  Test the systems.

# Teaching Tip  
It is important that all students have enough time to solve these problems by working at their own pace. Be patient. Engage students who finish early in one of the "Extended Learning" activities.

[/tip]

## **Wrap-up** (10  min) 
### 4) Reflect on student learning.

- Instruct students to record the results of their work in their journals, especially noting how they finally solved the challenges and overcame obstacles. 
- If there is enough time, regroup student teams into larger groups to share solutions. 


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Web Search 
Research these terms on the web and record a brief description of how it relates to sending bits: ASCII, Morse code, byte. Your description can be text, an image/sketch, a recording, or any other communication form that effectively communicates your knowledge.

## Assessment Questions
- How many bits do you need to send one letter?
- How did you use this information to decompose the problem of communicating a word using the bit-sending device? Describe your thought process and problem-solving strategies.
- How do you think a computer converts a keypress into bits? 

## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principle Learning Objectives

 2.1.1 Describe the variety of abstractions used to represent data. [P3]  
 2.1.2 Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. [P5]


### Other standards 

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*
 
Computational Thinking 

- 3B-7. Discuss the interpretation of binary sequences in a variety of forms (e.g., instructions, numbers, text, sound, image).
- 2-12. Use abstraction to decompose a problem into sub-problems.

Collaboration   

- 2-4: Exhibit dispositions necessary for collaboration: providing useful feedback, integrating feedback, understanding and accepting multiple perspectives, socialization. 

*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

 - 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
 - 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
 - 4. Model with mathematics.
 - 6. Attend to precision.
 - 7. Look for and make use of structure

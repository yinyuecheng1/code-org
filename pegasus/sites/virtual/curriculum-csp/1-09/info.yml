title: Hexadecimal Number System
description: "In this lesson, students will learn about hexadecimal representation of values in two environments in which they are very comfortable thinking about--color and Unicode characters. They will use JavaScript to analyze representing colors in a variety of systems including RGB color names and values. Unicode character hexadecimal representation provides a unique opportunity to deduce numeric patterns. At the end of the lesson, students are invited to think about an algorithm for converting between decimal and hexadecimal numbers. The activity continues in Lesson 10.

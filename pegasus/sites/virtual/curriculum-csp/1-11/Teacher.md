## Lesson Overview (Discovery)
In this lesson, students will experiment with pixelation tools to discover the binary and hexadecimal representations of the pixel images they create. They will be able to describe how a digital image is represented in the computer and discuss the decisions that have to be made in working with images,identify problems and trade offs when creating and sending digital images, and discover the connections between the binary and hexadecimal representations of color. Creating and sharing Favicons is an engaging activity that will reinforce student learning about images and color value representation.

## Materials, Resources and Prep

### For the Student
- Access to [Pixelation Tool 2](Resources/Pixelation_v2.html)
- Access to [http://favicon-generator.org/editor/](http://favicon-generator.org/editor/)
- *Student Activity Guide: Encoding a B&W image*
- *Student Activity Guide: Creating a Personal Favicon*   
- *Student Activity Guide: Understanding Color* (Extended Learning)
- All of the student activities are available in a [PDF composite](Resources/U1-L11_Student_activities_composite.pdf).
- Journal

### For the Teacher
- Access to [Pixelation Tool 2](Resources/Pixelation_v2.html)
- Access to [http://favicon-generator.org/editor/](http://favicon-generator.org/editor/)
- Access to [Pixelation Tool 3](Resources/Pixelation_v3.html) (Extended Learning)
- A projection system


## **Getting Started** (10 min)
### 1) Class discussion.
- Pose the question: How do you think a image is represented on a computer? 
-  Project a list of student ideas to return to after the activities.

## **Activity: Black and White Pixel Editor** (20 min)  
### 2) Examine the representation of black and white images.

-  Distribute the *Student Activity Guide: Encoding a B&W image*
-  Instruct students to use a Black and White Pixel Editor to create an image and share the file with others using [Pixelation Tool 2](Resources/Pixelation_v2.html).
-  Instruct students to use the same tool to open the image file they received from another classmate.
-  Discuss the problems involved when decoding an image from the other classmate.
-  Discussion: What kinds of problems can occur when sending and receiving pictures?


## **Activity: Color Pixel** (20 min)
### 3) Examine the representation of color images.

-  Distribute the *Student Activity Guide: Creating a Personal Favicon*   
-  Visit a website for creating Favicons such as [http://favicon-generator.org/editor/](http://favicon-generator.org/editor/)
-  Guide students to make their own Favicon or import an image to make into a Favicon.
- Discussion: How does the Favicon website eliminate some of the problems experienced in Activity 2? Does it introduce new problems? 

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 4) Reflection of student learning
- Refer back to the list of ideas shared by students at the beginning of the class period.
- Instruct students to write a more correct answer to the question in their journal.


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Experiment with Color by Varying the Number of Bits
-  A color is represented by 8 bits. Use this tool and the *Student Activity Guide: Understanding Color* to see how you can represent pictures with fewer or more than 8 bits. Summarize your learning by comparing the results of your experimentation.

## Assessment Questions
- How is an image represented in a computer?
- What kinds of problems can occur when sending and receiving pictures?
- What decisions must be made when creating a digital image representation? What are the trade-offs?
- How many bits are used to represent color in a pixel? Relate your answer to what you know about binary and hexadecimal representations.

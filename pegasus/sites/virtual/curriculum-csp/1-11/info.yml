They will be able to describe how a digital image is represented in the computer and discuss the decisions that have to be made in working with images,identify problems and trade offs when creating and sending digital images, and discover the connections between the binary and hexadecimal representations of color. Creating and sharing Favicons is an engaging activity that will reinforce student learning about images and color value representation.

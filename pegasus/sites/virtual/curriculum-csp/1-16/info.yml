title: Lossy and Lossless Compression
description: "This lesson expands on the concepts of Lesson 15. After learning about compression and how to compute a compression percentage, students will consider the difference between lossy and lossless compression. Students see one example of lossy and one example of lossless compression in the context of text, while reinforcing their knowledge of how to compute compression. Students will then investigate the pixelation of images with an online tool, and will independently compute compression. The lesson ends with a group discussion about whether pixelation is lossy or lossless.

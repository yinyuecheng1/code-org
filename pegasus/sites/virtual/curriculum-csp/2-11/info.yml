title: Internet Routing Game - Day 2
description: "In this lesson, students conclude the internet routing game by extrapolating from what they have learned in the game about how the Internet works. Students will try to develop algorithms for their routing strategies, and also consider the potential impacts of routers' ability to inspect information. Finally, as a preview for lessons to come, students will briefly analyze the graph algorithms learned so far in terms of computational complexity. The conclusion is that even though the algorithms might be complex and difficult to understand, in the worst case scenario, the problems can require processing a considerable amount of information, and that these are problems that can be computed.

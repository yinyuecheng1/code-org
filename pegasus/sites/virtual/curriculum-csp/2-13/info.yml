title: Map Coloring
description: "In this lesson, students explore another graph algorithm: the map coloring problem and various questions related to it. The major goal is for students to discover the types of tasks and questions that are easy for a computer to solve and those that are hard for a computer to solve. Students will write an algorithm for a series of problems related to maps to generate a better understanding of algorithms that are hard - meaning they take a long time to solve. They will also learn about decision versus optimization problems.

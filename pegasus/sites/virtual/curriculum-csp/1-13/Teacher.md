## Lesson Overview (Creative)
In this lesson, students will explore the concept of "Internet of Things." Collaborating in a team project, they will conceptualize a device that collects data and sends it through the Internet. Then they will create a file format for sending the collected data using their knowledge of file formats and binary and hexadecimal numbers. Creativity, problem analysis, and collaboration are important elements of this lesson.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 10 minutes
1) Class discussion:  What devices in this room are connected to the Internet? 

### **Activity: The Internet of Things** - 5  minutes  
2) View a video on the Internet of Things.


### **Activity: Conceptualizing a Connected Device**  - 30 minutes
3) Conceptualize a device for the Internet of Things.  
4) Design a sample file format. 


### **Wrap-up** - 5  minutes 
5) Share ideas with the class.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...   

- Determine if a device is part of the Internet of Things.  
- Collaborate to generate an idea for a device that could be an element of the Internet of Things. 
- Analyze the what data it might collect, sensors it would need, and how the data would be stored and used.
- Create a file format for the data the conceptualized device would generate.


# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal

### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet to show the video "Internet of Things."[http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/overview/article/iot_video.html](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/overview/article/iot_video.html)  

## **Getting Started** (5 min)
### 1) Think-Pair-Share.
- Pose the question: What devices in this room are connected to the Internet? 
- Students can communicate their ideas through a whip-around.
- In a large group discussion, generate a list of devices. Post the list to refer to in the next activity.  

## **Activity: The Internet of Things** (10  min)  
### 2) Video on the Internet of Things. 
- View the video and discuss briefly if students have questions.
- Modify the list created in the Getting Started activity as necessary.


## **Activity: Conceptualizing a Connected Device**  (30 min)
### 3) Creating a device for the Internet of Things.
Form teams of 2 students. Provide these instructions to the teams.

- With a partner, imagine a device that might someday be a part of the Internet of Things, but is currently not in existence.  
- Answer the following questions in your journal. 
 - What is the purpose of this device?
 - What data will your device collect?  
 - What sensors will it use?  
 - Who will make use of the data? 
 - What will be the range of values needed to store the data? 


### 4) Design a sample file format.
Guide students with these directions:

- Discuss with your partner:  
 - Will the data be converted into binary or hexadecimal?
 - How will that data be stored in a file format? 
 - Design a sample file format.

## **Wrap-up** (5 min) 
### 5) Share ideas. 
- Ask for teams to volunteer to share their ideas. Be sure they communicate the ideas about the data discussed in step 4.


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Metadata
Research the topic of metadata. What is the difference between data and metadata? Give several examples of everyday data that has associated metadata. What kind of metadata will be generated the device you conceptualized?  (Metadata will be discussed in further detail in Unit 5.)


## Assessment Questions
- What makes a device an element on the "Internet of Things?"
- How realistic is it that the device you conceptualized could be made available to consumers in the next 12 months?  
- List typical elements of a file format.  
- What kind of impact would your device have on individuals, families, and communities? 
- Describe the collaboration between your team members in this project.

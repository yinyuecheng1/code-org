title: What is the "best" way to sort?
description: "In this lesson, we end the set of sorting activities by relating sorting to algorithms in the real world.  A further exploration of algorithm analysis with some new algorithms will sharpen their intuition about what should and shouldn't be 'counted' when analyzing algorithms, what is 'hard' for a computer to do, or what takes a 'long time.' Lastly, they will apply the techniques of sorting to other algorithms.

## Lesson Overview
In this lesson, we end the set of sorting activities by relating sorting to algorithms in the real world.  A further exploration of algorithm analysis with some new algorithms will sharpen their intuition about what should and shouldn't be "counted" when analyzing algorithms, what is "hard" for a computer to do, or what takes a "long time." Lastly, they will apply the techniques of sorting to other algorithms.

### For the Student
- Journal
- *Student Activity Guide: Searching and Sorting Guide*	

### For the Teacher
- Student Activity Guides to distribute (Under development)


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Recap: What is "work" for a computer? 
- Discuss ideas and elements from the previous lesson:
 -  What is "work" for a computer? 
 -  Why are algorithms measured the way they are?
- Clarify that in general we want two things from an algorithm: 
 - A correct solution for any given input;
 - And to use computational resources as efficiently as possible.

## Getting acquainted with pseudo code (10 min)
### 2) Act out pseudocode. 

- Distribute playing cards (or other manipulative) for students to use to test out the algorithms.
- Distribute the Activity Guide. Direct students' attention to Part I: Searching and Sorting. [*Student Activity Guide: Part I - Searching and Sorting*](U2_L5_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf) (Under development)
- Introduce the activity in Part I.
- Guide students in making sense of the pseudocode by tracing or acting it. (The pseudocode algorithm is for finding smallest element in a list.)
- The activity should make it fairly clear how an algorithm is expressed; check for understanding by asking a few students to explain the pseudocode in this example.

# Teaching Tip
Pseudo-code is the "real" way that computer scientists describe algorithms at a high level. Pseudo-code mimics the features of most programming languages.

## Explore: How long does it take? (20 min) 
### 3) Examine novel sorting algorithms. 
- Direct students' attention to Part II Pseudocode Sorting Algorithms.[*Student Activity Guide: Part II - Pseudocode Sorting Algorithms*](U2_L5_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf)
- Assign one of the sorting algorithms in the set to each pair of students.
- Instruct students to act out the algorithm using cards or the card sorting widget from Lesson 4 and answer these questions.
	- What does the algorithm do?
	- What is its running time?
	
### 4)Analyze a mystery sorting algorithm. 
- After they are comfortable with reading and being able to understand pseudocode, instruct students to complete Part III of the activity document and answer the questions. [*Student Activity Guide: Part III - The Mystery Algorithm*](U2_L5_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf)
	- What does the algorithm do?
	- What is its running time?

### Wrap-Up (10 min)
### 5) Think-Pair-Write-Share: Efficient Algorithms.
- Instruct students to discuss the following prompts with an elbow partner and then collaboratively write a response in their journals that incorporates the ideas of both partners. 
- What should and shouldn't be "counted" when analyzing algorithms?
- What is "hard" or time consuming for a computer to do?
- Why is the efficiency of algorithms important?

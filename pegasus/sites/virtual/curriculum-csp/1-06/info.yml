title: Representing Bits
description: "There are many different ways that a bit can be physically represented. In this lesson, students will learn how bits have been represented in the past and how bits are represented today. Appreciation of how bits were used to complete important tasks in the past adds a richness to their understanding of innovations such as the Jacquard loom using punch cards and how bits have been represented 
magnetically and with voltage and light. Please provide <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eL7g_o3lfgtdT1jiMZqUNh5_NCGBHqNGEj0t5K4d9hA/viewform?usp=send_form'> feedback on this lesson.</a>"

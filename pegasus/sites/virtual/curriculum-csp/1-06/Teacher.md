## Lesson Overview (Discovery)
There are many different ways that a bit can be physically represented. In this lesson, students will learn how bits have been represented in the past and how bits are represented today. Appreciation of how bits were used to complete important tasks in the past adds a richness to their understanding of innovations such as the Jacquard loom using punch cards and how bits have been represented 
magnetically and with voltage and light.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will... 

- Explain the importance of the Jacquard loom in computing and society. 
- Explain how bits are represented in punch cards, magnetically, with voltage, and with light.
- Analyze how technology can impact society: technologically, economically, socially.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- Access to a web browser to complete a web-quest
- Access to a collaborative file creation/sharing site, such as Google Documents


### For the Teacher
- Optional: punch cards of any kind
- Access to a web browser to show YouTube videos
- Create a document (Representing Bits) in the file sharing site and make it accessible to all of the students. Add 4 headings (Punch cards, Magnetic polarity, Electrical voltage, Light intensity) under which students will add content in Activity 3.

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) The Music Wagon video.
- Preview this lesson as a historical perspective about how problems have been solved using bits for a long time. Understanding the innovations of the past provide a deeper understanding of the significance of today's innovations. After the student's challenges with the bit-sending device, the sophistication of historical devices can be inspiring.
- Show the Music Wagon video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8nwq7KV9HI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8nwq7KV9HI). Tell students to watch closely so that they might be able to discern how it works.
- Instruct students to record in their journal about how they think it works.

# Teaching Tip
When showing videos it is sometimes helpful to pause periodically to ask students questions about what they understand. To abide by school content guidelines, be cautious of what other videos might be recommended by the site.

## Activity: Storing patterns with the Jacquard loom (10 min)
### 2) Jacquard loom: early computer programming.
- View the video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwozgRPLVC8](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwozgRPLVC8).
- If you have punch cards, pass them around while students are watching the video.

## Activity: Represent Bits in Computers (15 min)

### 3) Collaborative web-quest.

- Group students into small teams. 
Assign each team to research how computers represent bits with one of the following:

 - Punch cards
 - Magnetic polarity 
 - Electrical voltage 
 - Light intensity 

- Students can record their findings in a common file such as a Google Document so that all students can edit and see the combined results of the research. Encourage students to create or add images that more completely illustrate what they have learned.

# Teaching Tip  
The research and writing activity in this lesson present an opportunity to talk about copyright laws and emphasize that copied content must be credited to the rightful author or organization.

[/tip]

## Wrap-up (15 min)
### 4) Sharing the research 
- Allow students in each group to briefly share the most important details about what they learned about their assigned topics. If more than one group researched the same topic, they can report to the class as one team.
- Encourage the class to ask questions.
- Ask students if they know of any additional ways to represent bits.

# Teaching Tip  
Model writing skills through a variety of writing opportunities and prompts that encourage students to write complete sentences that clearly communicate their ideas.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace
- Research the machines designed and programmed by Charles Babbage and programmed by Ada Lovelace. How did these machines represent bits?  Investigate their intellectual roles in creating their machine designs. 
- Communicate your learning in any effective format. Consider images,  a collage, a recording, a screen play script, or a compare-and-contrast chart of the contributions to computer science of both Babbage and Lovelace.
- Prepare to discuss your findings with the class.

### Hollerith's Tabulation Machine
- Research the machines that were designed by Herman Hollerith. How did these machines represent bits? What was the purpose of the machines? How did his device change history? Predict how history might have been different if Hollerith hadn't created this device? 
- Prepare to discuss your findings with the class.

### Learn about Qbits
- Research Qbit. How it is used in quantum computing. Be particularly attentive to the vocabulary used to describe this technology. What implications does it have for the future of computing? Report your findings in any effective format.
- Prepare to discuss your findings with the class.

### Weaving

- Create a small weaving project by following the directions shown in  the video about the Jacquard loom: [http://tinyurl.com/m5cekcf](http://tinyurl.com/m5cekcf).
- Respond in your journal: How did the invention of the Jacquard weaving loom change society (consider technologically, economically, socially)? Compare these changes to those brought by a recent innovation in computing technology? Be sure to speculate on the long-term impact and significance.


## Assessment Questions
- Describe the pattern for even and odd numbers that you see in the binary number system. Speculate on why this pattern exists.
- Explain why the binary number system used in computers?
- Why is the Jacquard loom important in the history of computing. 
- How are bits  represented in punch cards.
- How are bits  represented  magnetically.
- How are bits  represented with voltage.
- How are bits  represented with light.

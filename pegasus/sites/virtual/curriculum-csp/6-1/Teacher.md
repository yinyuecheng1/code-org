## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Models and simulations facilitate the formulation and refinement of hypotheses related to the objects or phenomena under consideration. Hypotheses are formulated to explain the  objects or phenomena being modeled. Hypotheses are refined by examining the insights that models and simulations provide into the objects or phenomena. The results of simulations may generate new knowledge and new hypotheses related to the phenomena being modeled.

The results of simulations may generate new knowledge and new hypotheses related to the 
phenomena being modeled. Simulations allow hypotheses to be tested  without the constraints of the real world. Simulations can facilitate extensive and rapid  testing of models. The time required for simulations is  impacted by the level of detail and quality of the  models, and the software and hardware used for the simulation. Rapid and extensive testing allows models to be changed to accurately reflet the objects being modeled.

# Teaching Tip  
Tip

[/tip]

## Checking for Understanding
- Give an example of a hypothesis that you could test with a simulation
- 



## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Design your own Simulation

- Think of an interesting computer simulation that you wish were available.  Describe what the simulation would look like and how it would run on a device.

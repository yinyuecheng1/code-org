## Lesson Objectives

### The students will...

- Differentiate between String and numerical data 
- Declare variables of appropriate data type in the context of a JavaScript program

# Teaching Guide  
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student

- The ASCII Chart WHERE DO THEY GET THIS?  
- *Student Activity Guide: Data Types*

### For the Teacher

- *Presentation: String vs. Numeric Data Types*

## Getting Started (10 min)

1) Variables in Binary NOT SURE THIS IS THE BEST TITLE....

- Pose this challenge to student teams: WHEN DID YOU FORM TEAMS??
 -  Using the ASCII chart translate the word “data” to binary
 - Instruct them to compare their answers with their elbow partners. Did you solve the problem the same way?
 -  Engage the entire class in a discussion about how they solved the problem. Discuss with the group, “Does it take more memory to store a single number or a word?”
 -  Review homework answers from Lesson 2 in a discussion. What rules exist for naming variables in JavaScript? Does your list match your partner's list? 

## Activity: String and Numeric Data Types (30 min)

2) *Presentation: String vs. Numeric Data Types*.  
- Stop periodically to check for student understanding and to answer questions.  
3) Independent Practice – String vs. Numeric Data Types   
- Instruct the students to complete the *Student Activity Guide: String vs. Numeric Data Types*. 

## Wrap-up (5 min)

4) Poll – Is it a number or a string?
This activity is the last slide of the presentation.  

 
5) Assign this as an out-of-class activity.  
Create a Lunch Account App    
Direct students: You have been hired to design an app to enable students check the funds available in their lunch account balance. Think about what it should do and how it would look. Respond in your journal:

- What features should the app have?  
- What type(s) of data will your program need to store?
- Design a program menu; sketch, write, or type.  
- What user input will be needed?
- When coding a solution, which of these is more important for this app: security, efficiency, memory usage, reliability, ease of coding ? Defend your answer.   
DO THESE CONCEPTS NEED TO BE IN THE PRESENTATION... HOW WILL THEY KNOW HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS?

# Teaching Tip

Make purposeful connections to the concepts of binary numbers and data compression that the students studied in Unit 1. If they have a good understanding of how data is stored in memory the concepts of variables and data types will be much easier to understand.

[/tip]

## Extended Learning
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Extending the Getting Started Activity

Ask students how they could make storing the String "data" in binary more efficient by taking advantage of the fact that the letter 'a' appears twice in the word.


## Assessment Questions
- TBD


## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives


-  2.1.2 Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data. [P5]

### Other Standards
*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*:

Computational Thinking 
 
- 3A-7. Describe how various types of data are stored in a computer system.

Computing Practice and Programming  

- 2.5. Implement problem solutions using a programming language, including: looping behavior, conditional statements, logic, expressions, variables, and functions.
- 3A-3. Use various debugging and testing methods to ensure program correctness.

*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*
- TBD

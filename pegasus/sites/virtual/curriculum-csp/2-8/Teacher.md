## Lesson Overview (Discovery)

In this lesson, students are introduced to the concept of a "graph" in computer science. Students are asked to conceive of a graph representation of some data, and then compare the results. Students learn graph terminology and are asked to explore the kinds of problems that algorithms on graphs might solve.

- *Student Activity Guide: Friends List*

### For the Teacher
- Prepare Student Activity Guides

## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Preview using graphs to solve problems.
- In the previous lessons, students learned about algorithms, how to express them, and how to analyze them. Most of the algorithms they worked with were concerned with dealing with lists of various things. Lists are a fundamental structure for storing data in computer science, so understanding algorithms that work with lists is fundamental as well.
- However, the next set of algorithms that students study about representing and processing is a bit more sophisticated. Their understanding of algorithms and ability to think about computational solutions to problems will also get more sophisticated.


## Activity: Visualizing Relationships in Data (40)
### 2) Draw graphs to represent data.
- Form student teams of two students each.
	- Distribute the [*Student Activity Guide: Friends List*](http://#)
	- Explain the "Directions for Team of Two" on the activity guide. Check for understanding.
	- NOTE: Although all students are drawing a graph to represent the data in the lists, the actual data differs between groups.
	- Provide time for each time to complete the activity.

-Re-groups students
	- Position teams with the same data together to form a group of four.
	- Instruct students to compare their representations of the data and note similarities and differences.
	- The group of 4 should follow the directions and answer the questions under "Directions for Team of Four" on the activity guide.

- Large group sharing	
	- Ask groups to nominate a person from their team of four to explain their data to the class and show how they represented it as a graph.
	- Ensure that at least one group representing each of the different types of data presents their work. Ask other groups with the same data set to add any comments they feel necessary.

### 3) Review graph concepts
- Clarify graph terminology (nodes, edges, weights)
- Explain that algorithms on graphs are very important in computer science because there are many instances of data where we are concerned with how all the elements of data relate to each other.

## Wrap-up (5 min)

### 4) Journal: What kinds of problems would lend themselves to solutions using graphs?
- Pick one of the data sets that you did not work on that you think is interesting.  
- Imagine that you had a huge quantity of this type of data...more than you could visualize on one piece of paper or screen. 
- Think of a question that you might be able to answer using an algorithm on the graph of that data.

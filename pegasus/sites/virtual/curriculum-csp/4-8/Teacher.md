## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Digital information often is messy with errors and omissions. Typically it must to be cleaned or combined electronically before it can be turned into useful information. In this lesson, students learn to identify messy data, as well as describe ways to clean data. Students will practice their skills using an example data set.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 5 minutes
1) Journal Prompt: "What does it mean to clean something such as your room or a car?"

### **Activity: Cleaning Data** - 20  minutes  
2) Video: Cleaning Messy Data.  
3) Practice cleaning data.

### **Activity: Looking for Clusters of Data** - 20  minutes  
4) Find clusters of baby names.

### **Wrap-up** - 5  minutes 
5) Summarize student learning.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Explain what it means to "clean data."
- Give an example of a data that needs cleaning.
- Describe processes used to clean data.
- Find a data set that needs cleaning.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student journal
- Access to a description of Google Refine at [https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/](https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/)
- Access to the resource file *messyData.csv*
- Access to Social Security Baby Names site at [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/#ht=1]http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/#ht=1)
- Access to the resource file *messyData.csv*

### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet
- Access the the resource file *messyData.csv* in the Resource Folder


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Journal Prompt:  
- "What does it mean to clean something such as your room or a car?"

## Activity: Cleaning Data (30 min)
### 2) Video: Cleaning Messy Data.
- Watch the video at [https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/](https://code.google.com/p/google-refine/)
- As preparation for the video, write the words **Messy, Clean, Filter, Combine,** and **Cluster** on the board. Assign each student one of the words. Direct them to record how the word is used in the video.
- After the video, engage students in a discussion of what they learned.

# Teaching Tip  
During a video with complicated information, it is helpful to pause the video periodically and ask a questions to check for understanding.

### 3) Practice Cleaning Data.

- Direct students to the resource file *messyData.csv*.
- Guide them to import the file into a spreadsheet.
- The tasks for them are to find the "messy" content and to clean it using strategies similar to what they saw in the video.
- Summarize what students found and the processes they used.

## Activity: Looking for Clusters of Data (20 min)
### 4) Find clusters of baby names.

- Direct students to the Social Security Baby Names website. [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/#ht=1](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/#ht=1)
- Generate a table of data for the students' birth year with 1000 names.
- Copy the table data on the web page and paste it into an empty spreadsheet.  This may take a while. 
- Direct students to find a cluster of names that all sound the same, such as Caitlyn, Katelyn, and Kaitlyn.
- Modify the spreadsheet so that these names are combined. In this way, names that sound the same but have different spellings will move up in the rankings.

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 5) Summarize student learning.
- Ask students to share the results of their clustering. What names did they cluster? Speculate on why this is helpful.


## Checking for Understanding

- Why is it important to have clean data?
- Describe what is observable in data that "needs to be cleaned."
- Describe two methods for cleaning data.
- Find a data set that needs cleaning. Describe the problems you notice and the process you would use to clean it.


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Finding a Data Set

- Find three different data sets, from any source and about any topic.  Which of the three data sets needs the most cleaning?  What do you see that will require cleaning? 


## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives

- 3.1.1 Use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge. [P4]


### Other Standards

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

- CT.L2-15 Provide examples of interdisciplinary applications of computational thinking. 
- CPP.L3B-07 Use data analysis to enhance understanding of complex natural and human systems. 
 

*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively. 
- 6. Attend to precision.

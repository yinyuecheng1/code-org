## Lesson Overview (New Learning)

In this lesson, students examine techniques for searching for an element in a list. Binary search is formalized as students use a widget similar to the card sorting widget. The lesson lays the groundwork for more sophisticated network searching problems in the lessons that follow. Both sequential search and binary search are "essential knowledge" for the Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles assessment.

### For the Student
- Searching Algorithm Widget (under development)

### For the Teacher


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Recall features of pseudo-code.
- Engage students to recall the features of pseudo-code used to express loops, variables, and array access in the previous lessons.
- Recall that sorting/searching on lists of simple elements is an **abstraction** of the "real" thing.
- Check for understanding by using a thumbs-up/thumbs-down response on key concepts.
 
### 2) Re-motivate searching and sorting problems
- Having learned to solve problems that involve sorting and searching *numbers* makes it easier to solve non-number problems; if we can sort numbers we can sort anything that can be compared!

## Activity: Find a fast way to search (10 min)
### 3) Journal: searching
 - Think-Pair-Share: 
 - Ask students to list non-numbered, real-world things that they search for or sort/order in their daily lives.
 - If your task is to find an element in a long list, how would the algorithms differ if the list is sorted or unsorted?
 - Students will probably suggest a divide and conquer strategy (i.e. binary search) encourage that thought and move on to the next activity.
 
## Activity: Write a searching algorithm (30 min) 
### 4) Collaboratively write searching algorithms.
 - Group students into teams of two.
 - Assign them to write an algorithm in pseudocode to find an element in an **unsorted** list (sequential search).
 - Now write the algorithm to find an element in a **sorted** list (binary search).
 
### 5) Translate pseudocode to programming blocks.
 - Assign teams to translate their pseudo-code into the [Searching Algorithm Widget (under development)].
 - The widget will help them visualize and more deeply understand the algorithms.


## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 6) Compare searching algorithms.
- Instruct students to respond in their journals:
 - Summarize the differences between searching a sorted/ordered and an unsorted/unordered list.
 - Describe any difficulties you encountered in translating pseudocode into the language of the widget.

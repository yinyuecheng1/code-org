title: How Can We Find It?
description: "In this lesson, students examine techniques for searching for an element in a list. Binary search is formalized as students use a widget similar to the card sorting widget. The lesson lays the groundwork for more sophisticated network searching problems in the lessons that follow. Both sequential search and binary search are 'essential knowledge' for the AP CSP assessment.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In this lesson, students learn to request input information in a computer program. They will work with variables in a generic sense without yet worrying about the type of data being stored.  As they work through the practice problems, the teacher should focus on their debugging skills. The ability to identify problems and correct programming errors when a program is not producing the correct output is key to self-sufficiency and future success in coding.

# Teaching Guide 
## Materials, Resources and Prep 
### For the Students 

- *Student Activity Guide: Warm-p with ASCII Art*
- *Student Activity Guide: Input Practice Exercises*
- Journal

### For the Teacher 

- *Teacher Presentation: Input with JavaScript*


## Getting Started (15 min) 

### 1) Warm up with ASCII art. 
- Guide students to complete the warm-up with the *Student Activity Guide: Warm-up with ASCII Art*. 

## Activity: Practice New Skills (30 min) 
### 2) Guided practice - input in JavaScript. 

- Guide students through each lab exercise using the *Teacher Presentation: Input with JavaScript*. 
- Stop the presentation between problems to demonstrate the correct code and help students correct their own code.  

### 3) Independent Practice. 
- Instruct students to independently complete exercises on the *Student Activity Guide: Practice Input Exercises*. 
- Use the challenge problem at the end of the activity to challenge those students who complete the work more quickly.


## Wrap-up (5 min) 

### 4) Journal entry.
- Record these questions in your journal and answer outside of class, if necessary: 

 -  List three rules for naming variables.
 -  What limitations are there on variable names in JavaScript? 
 -  For a game program, why would the variable name "score" better than "x"? 


## Extended Learning
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

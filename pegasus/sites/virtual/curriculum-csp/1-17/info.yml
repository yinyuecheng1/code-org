title: Modeling a Performance Task
description: "This lesson models the Advanced Placement® Performance Task® process. Students collaborate in responding to a writing prompt and then submit an individual reflection of the collaborative process. The language of this practice task mimics the language of the Performance Tasks students will submit to the College Board™ later in the year as a part of the AP™ assessment. The goal of this activity is to create an opportunity for students to practice writing and receive an assessment of their performance. 
The topic for their writing is data compression. Students will select a compressed digital artifact and collaboratively explore and write about the positive and negative results of the compression of that artifact. For instance, the MP3 music format has made music widely available while fundamentally changing how we experience sound quality.

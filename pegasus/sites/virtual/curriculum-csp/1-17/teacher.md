## Lesson Overview (Assessment)
This lesson models the Advanced Placement® Performance Task® process. Students collaborate in responding to a writing prompt and then submit an individual reflection of the collaborative process. The language of this practice task mimics the language of the Performance Tasks students will submit to the College Board™ later in the year as a part of the AP™ assessment. The goal of this activity is to create an opportunity for students to practice writing and receive an assessment of their performance.

The topic for their writing is data compression. Students will select a compressed digital artifact and collaboratively explore and write about the positive and negative results of the compression of that artifact. For instance, the MP3 music format has made music widely available while fundamentally changing how we experience sound quality.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Participate in peer assessment

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- *Student Activity Guide: Model Performance Task*
- *Student Activity Guide: Peer Review*
- *Student Activity: Performance Task Rubric*
- Highlighters
- Stickable notes or a digital tool for collecting notes (i.e. Linoit.com)

### For the Teacher
- Prepare copies of the Student Activity documents [U1-L17_Composite_Activity_Documents.pdf](resources/U1-L17_Composite-Activity_Documents.pdf).



## Getting Started (10 min)
1) Think-Pair-Share
Journal entry: List as many examples of digital media as you can think of that are compressed files.

# Teaching Tip
 Before starting the model performance task, it is essential that students understand data compression and can cite several examples. Class time is allowed for much of the collaborative work in this activity, but it may be necessary to complete some portions outside of class. The process of writing the rough draft may require several class periods.

[/tip]

### 
- List as many examples of digital media as you can think of that are compressed files.
- Give the students about three minutes to complete their list. 
- Instruct students to compare notes and discuss their lists with an elbow partner.
- Invite students to share examples of digitally compressed artifacts.
 - What type of digital compression was used?
 - What problems does compression solve for this type of media?

 
## Activity: Understand the Performance Task (20 min)
### 2) Analyze the model performance task directions.

NOTE: “Single digital artifact” means a particular song, book, poem, map, or other compressed digital item. The strategy is for the student to pick a particular item of personal meaning, and investigate the representative file type of the particular item.

- Distribute materials (Student Activity Guide: Model Performance Task, highlighters and stickable notes).
- Instruct students to individually read the Student Activity Guide and to highlight words/phrases that are unclear.
- When students have finished reading and highlighting they should write the highlighted words/phrases on stickable notes or use a digital tool. Ask them to write one word/phrase per note.
- Collect the stickyable notes. Look for common phrases and themes and arrange the notes, putting common words/phrases together.
- Define and clarify each of the words/phrases. 
- Involve the students in a discussion to clarify the terms on the stickable notes.
- Emphasize: What does "explain why" mean? 
- Homework assignment: Using the definitions and clarifications from reading the Student Activity Guide: Model Performance Task, students should rephrase the questions in the "Collaborative" and "Individual Summary" sections of the Student Activity Guide: Model Performance Task so that they understand the directions clearly.

## Activity: Select and research a topic (20 min)
### 3) Select an artifact. 
- Assign the partners. Note: If you have an odd number of students there may be one group of three. Allow 5 minutes for students to brainstorm to create a list of things that use digital compression.
- Ask students to select just one item from the list. Encourage them to be as specific as possible and to think about the various forms in which this item might be available. (Example: If a group selects a particular song, they might recognize that it could be digital, analog, printed, etc.)
 

## Activity:  The writing process (50 min)
### 4) Write the first draft of the collaborative summary.  

- Instruct students to use online resources to learn about the compression used in the chosen artifact. At least one resource must be less than 12 months old. Students are required to address these questions in their research (listed on the Student Activity Guide: Model Performance Task):
  - Explain why your group selected the digital artifact used in your investigation.
What type of data is compressed? 
  - Describe the steps used in the compression. Be sure to include why it is used and what problem it is solving.
  - Describe the beneficial effects of the digital compression used in the creation of the digital artifact.
  - Describe the limitations of the digital compression. 
  - Compare and contrast the digitally compressed version to an analog version of the same artifact. How does the compression impact our experience with this artifact?
- This is also a good time to remind students to consider the source of the information. Is it reliable? Why do they think so? 
- Students will use the notes from their research to produce a draft of the collaborative summary (described on the Student Activity Guide: Performance Task). 
-  Circulate and ask questions about how they are answering the questions.

## Activity: Peer Review (50 min)
### 5) Feedback on the collaborative summary. 
- Instruct students to print their collaborative summary and exchange with another group.
- Complete the Student Activity Guide: Peer Review 
- For each of the prompts on the collaborative summary, answer these questions:
  - What are the strengths of the explanation? 
  - What is missing from the explanation?

## Activity: Write the summaries (50 min)
### 6) Create final reports. 

- Guide students to write their final versions of the model performance task collaborative summary.  
- When the  collaborative summary is complete and turned in, each student should independently write an individual summary and turn it in.

## Assessment Questions

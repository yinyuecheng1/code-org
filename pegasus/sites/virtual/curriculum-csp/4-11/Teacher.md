## Lesson Overview (Exploration)
In this lesson, students will review how data analysis leads to insight and knowledge. Packaged data from the Gapminder website is used in this lesson to highlight the insight and knowledge derived through data analysis. Additionally, students will be review the concepts of cleaning, combining, clustering, organizing, and visualizing data.

- Use visualizations to provide insight and knowledge. 

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Journal
- Access to Gampinder.org [http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-river-of-myths/#.U9P9UYBdX6I](http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-river-of-myths/#.U9P9UYBdX6I)

### For the Teacher
- Access to the video at Gampinder.org [http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-river-of-myths/#.U9P9UYBdX6I](http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-river-of-myths/#.U9P9UYBdX6I)


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Journal Prompt: What do you think of when you hear the phrase 'developing country'?

## Activity: The River of Myths (15 min)
### 2) "The River of Myths" video from Gapminder.org.

- As a class, watch the video [http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-river-of-myths/#.U9P9UYBdX6I](http://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-river-of-myths/#.U9P9UYBdX6I)
- Guide a class discussion about how the world is changing but some myths still persist. Include:
 - Evidence that myth is no longer true.
 - How data provides insight and knowledge on this topic.
 - The use of clustering as shown in the video.
 - Trends that are apparent in data.


## Activity: Using Gapminder(25 min)
### 3) Demonstration of Gapminder.
- From the main page at Gampinder.org, select "Wealth and Health of Nations." Demonstrate these techniques:
 - Press Play or to drag the year to a certain spot.
 - Change the axes from linear 'lin' to logarithmic 'log.'
 - Track a country.
 - Change the quantities on the axis scales.

### 4) Independent Investigation.
- Allow students time to explore Gapminder.
- Instruct students to think of a question they would like answered about a country and then hypothesize an answer.
- Encourage students to find a data set that can be used to answer their question. Circle back to their hypothesis; were they correct? If not, what did they learn from the data they analyzed.
- How does visualization of data impact the stories told by the data analysis on Gapminder?

## Wrap-up Reflection (5 min)
### 5) Journal Prompt: Summarize your investigation in Gapminder. 
- Reflect on how data can be used to debunk myths. Are there other "ideas" that we assume are correct that could be tested with data?


## Checking for Understanding
- Recall your exploration on the Gapminder website, identify the data, the information, and the knowledge you gained. 
- What "wisdom"  could be gleaned from this experience with Gampimder.org? 


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Your Own Investigation

- Conduct another investigation Gampminder data.  Visit [http://www.gapminder.org/data/](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). Summarize what you believe to be true about another country. Find data to confirm or refute your belief.


## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives
- 3.1.1 Use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge. [P4]
- 3.1.2 Collaborate when processing information to gain insight and knowledge. [P6]
- 3.2.1 Extract information from data to discover and explain connections, patterns, or trends. [P1]
- 3.2.2. Use large data sets to explore and discover information and knowledge. [P3]

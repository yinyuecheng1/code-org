## Lesson Overview (Assessment)

This lesson is designed for two class meetings. Student understanding will be assessed through a lab project in which they must calculate values using JavaScript and the JavaScript Math Class. In the first class meeting, students will begin the lab assignment. In the second class meeting they will complete the project and take a quiz on concepts related to math calculations. The lab project is larger than any they have worked on up to this point in Unit 3. They will be required to solve a problem requiring a variety of math calculation and execute testing and debugging strategies.

- *Student Quiz: Calculations in JavaScript*

### For the Teacher

- TBD



## Getting Started (Day 1) (10 min)

### 1) Understanding the lab assignment – Calculations  
Check for understanding:

- Instruct the students to independently read the *Student Activity Guide: Lab Assignment - Calculations in JavaScript* document
- Ask 1 or 2 students to describe what they understand the task to be.  
- Answer questions. 

## Activity: Lab Project (35 min)
### 2) Independent work on the lab assignment 
- Monitor student progress.
- Avoid answering questions directly; instead, ask the students questions that will guide them to being able to answer their own question.  


## Wrap-up (Day 1) (5 min)
### 3) Journal entry – Progress

- Instruct students to record their progress on the lab project in a journal entry. They should record what they have accomplished, and what their next steps will be, as well as any problems they encountered that they should research before the next class meeting.

### 4) Review for the Quiz

- Assign students to review for the quiz the following day by reviewing their journal entries, Student Activity documents, projects and notes from Lessons 1-7. This is intended to be an out-of-class activity.

# Teaching Tip

One of the goals of CS Principles of for students to develop skills in evaluating algorithms for accuracy. This cannot be done by only testing the code on the computer; some analysis must happen away from the computer. Manually testing code against a specific set of inputs, known as empirical analysis, is one way to verify that a code segment is accurate.

## Getting Started (Day 2) (10 min)
### 5) Progress re-check

- Direct students to review the journal notes made at the end of the last class meeting before they begin the last phase of the project.
- Answer any questions that may pertain to the entire class. 


## Activity: Lab Project (35 min)
### 6) Quiz on calculations
- Distribute the *Student Quiz: Calculations in JavaScript*
- Answer any questions students have about the questions.

### 7) Independent work on the lab assignment 
- Monitor student progress.
- Avoid answering questions directly; instead, ask the students questions that will guide them to being able to answer their own question.

## Wrap-up (Day 2) (5 min)
### 8) Experience summary  
Direct students to respond to the following questions in their journals.
- Identify one error or bug you encountered while working on the lab project. 
- Describe the error and what you did to solve it. 
- How can you test your program to know that to works correctly and solves the problem? 

Assign students to complete the lab project outside of class if necessary.

# Teaching Tip

Testing code for accuracy is a difficult skill to learn. One technique is to add a thread in the class discussion board and ask students to post test data and expected results for lab assignments. The objective is to identify test data that will break the code. Because students are just learning how to test for accuracy, it is helpful for the teacher to add some test data to seed the thread.

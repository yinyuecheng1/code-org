We can 'know' an incredible volume of information from sources far beyond anything imaginable even a few years ago. We can 'do' and 'create' almost anything we can dream. We can monitor the health of our bodies and use devices to replace lost abilities. These innovations that extend human abilities - or overcome disabilities - deeply impact lives. Many have a secondary effects on society that can be even more profound than the immediate impact to individuals.

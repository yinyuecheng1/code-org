## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Computing technology has enhanced human abilities in astonishing ways. With the help of technology, we can "see" what is happening far away or as near as inside our bodies. We can "know" an incredible volume of information from sources far beyond anything imaginable even a few years ago. We can "do" and "create" almost anything we can dream. We can monitor the health of our bodies and use devices to replace lost abilities. These innovations that extend human abilities - or overcome disabilities - deeply impact lives. Many have a secondary impact on society that can be even more profound than the immediate impact to individuals. 

In this lesson, students will consider both the immediate and the secondary impacts of technical innovations. They will build skills in researching and writing about innovations including locating relevant and reliable information from a reputable sources and creating an online post about an innovation of their choice.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...   

- List several computing innovations that have enhanced human abilities or overcome disabilities.
- Describe the immediate and secondary effects of innovations.
- Identify reputable from non-reputable online sources. 
- Locate online resources that describe the technology of an innovation and its impact.
- Create a post on classroom blog or discussion board.
 
 
# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Access to online search tool
- Access to classroom blog or discussion board

### For the Teacher
- Access to a classroom blog or discussion board


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Think-Pair-Share: Enhancing Human Abilities.
- Instruct students to answer this question in their journal: "Identify at least one computing innovation that has enhanced what our bodies and minds can do?" 
- Share ideas with an elbow partner.


## Activity: Examining Technologies that Enhance Human Abilities (30 min)
### 2) Categorize enhancing technologies.
- Direct students to create a 3-column table in their journal to organize the responses from their classmates. Label the first column "Innovation" and the second "Human Ability Enhanced." 
- Leave the third column blank for now. Students will add to it in the next activity.
- Invite students to share the information in the first 2 columns with the class. 
- Each student should summarize what is shared by classmates in the appropriate columns.

### 3) Analyze secondary impacts of technologies.
- Label the third column, "Secondary Effect."
- Typically, computing innovations immediately and primarily impact or effect the individual using the technology. However, innovations that with the strongest societal effect often have a secondary effect that can be felt into the future or may impact people far removed from the original individual. 
- Direct students to work with their elbow partners to fill in the third column of the table.
- If time permits, invite students to share a few innovations with powerful secondary effects.

### 4) Learn more about enhancing technologies. 
- Students may collaborate with a partner for this activity.
- Ask students to choose one innovation from the lists they created with a partner.
- Direct students to use a search engine to locate two informational articles or websites from a reputable source about the innovation. One resource should describe how the innovation works and the second should describe the impact and effects of the innovation.
- Discuss with the class how to identify reputable sources. Refer to [http://library.citytech.cuny.edu/instruction/workshops/pdf/GoodGooglingS11.pdf](http://library.citytech.cuny.edu/instruction/workshops/pdf/GoodGooglingS11.pdf) for suggestions.
- Students will use the resources they find in the next activity.

## Wrap-up (15 min)
### 5) Create an online post.
- Instruct students to collaboratively write a short summary about what they learned about the chosen innovation in the classroom blog or discussion board.
- In the post students should describe the innovation, how it works, the primary impact or effect of the innovation, and any secondary impact of the innovation.
- They should embed links to the research resources and articles in the post.

# Teaching Tip  
Creating a post on a classroom blog or learning system is a motivating writing activity. If you are not sure how to set up a classroom blog or how to use a classroom discussion system, talk to one of your colleagues or the school technology assistant. Used well, this tool can reinforce communication skills and enhance student learning. 

[/tip]

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Interview with a User of an Enhancing Technology
If you are familiar with an individual who benefits from an abilities enhancing innovation or a technology that helps the individual overcome a disability, interview the person about the impact the technology has had on his or her life. Ask to questions about how the innovation works, how it has impacted the way they live; the ways they play or work. Ask about how it has impacted their family and friends. If possible, record the interview. Ask for permission to share with your classmates or to post online.

### Secondary Effects of a Communication Innovation
Choose one of the communication innovations discussed in Lesson 2. Write a paragraph or create a chart that explains the differences between the immediate impacts and the secondary impacts of the innovation.  

### Speculate about Today's Innovations
Select a recent innovation - something recently in the news. Predict the impact that this innovation will have on individuals. Predict any societal impacts you can foresee. Label the impacts as positive or negative. Explain your reasons for the label.

## Assessment Questions
- Give an example of a computing innovation that has enhanced human abilities or overcome disabilities in the area of physical mobility, strength, or endurance.
- Give an example of a computing innovation that has enhanced human abilities or overcome disabilities in the area of extended cognition or sensing abilities.
- List three things to evaluate in determining if an online resource is reputable or non-reputable.

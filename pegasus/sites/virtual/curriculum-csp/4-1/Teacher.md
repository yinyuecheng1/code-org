## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Students are surrounded by data.  How is it generated? What does it include? How can it be used? Why is it important to know about it? These questions will be explored in Unit 4.  

In this lesson, students ground their understanding of data and its usefulness through  a graphical representation called the Data Pyramid. This progression, from data to information to knowledge to wisdom provides students a mental framework for rest of the unit.

## Lesson Objectives 
The student will... 

- Describe the relationship between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. 
- Categorize examples of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.
- Give a real-world example of the pyramid of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.


# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Prepared set of content from the Student Activity Guide: Data Pyramid

### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet
- Background Reading: DIKW Pyramid. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid). 
- Background Reading:  The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Nursing Informatics Theory: Using the Data-Knowledge-Information-Wisdom Framework to Guide Informatics Research [http://tinyurl.com/kmhbx3r](http://tinyurl.com/kmhbx3r)
- Prepare the *Student Activity Guide: Data Pyramid*   [U4_L1_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf](U4_L1_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf) according to the directions at the top of the Activity document and place in envelopes.
- Blank strips of paper large enough to write a sentence, four per student team plus an envelope to hold the strips. 


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Whip-Around: "What do you think of when you hear these terms?  data, information, knowledge, wisdom." 
- "What do you think of when you hear the term...data?" Invite students to call out a word or short phrase. Take no more than a minute or two for this. 
- "What do you think of when you hear the term...information?" Invite students with the goal of getting different students for each word in this exercise. Use two minutes.
- "What do you think of when you hear the term...knowledge?"   
- "What do you think of when you hear the term...wisdom?" 
- If time, ask students if they see a progression, or ask them how these terms are related to each other. 
  

## Activity: The Data Pyramid(10 min)
### 2) Define the terms data, information, knowledge, and wisdom with a data pyramid.  
- Draw a data pyramid on the board, or display an image from an online [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIKW_Pyramid).
- There is no one definition for the terms in this pyramid or how they are related. However, in the domain of Nursing Informatics, this web article provides a useful interpretation: [http://tinyurl.com/kmhbx3r](http://tinyurl.com/kmhbx3r)
- Give a couple examples of a completed pyramid.
- Move on when your students feel comfortable using the terms data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.

## Activity: Progressing from Data to Wisdom (20 min)
### 3) Categorizing examples of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. 
- Place students into teams of 3 or 4.
- Give each team a prepared envelope with four strips cut from the Student Activity document. 
- Instruct the teams categorize the pieces of paper as data, information, knowledge, or wisdom. (Each envelope will hold a complete set.)
- Circulate around the room to gather formative assessment.
- After about 3 minutes direct the students to record their final categories and to put the pieces of paper back into the envelopes. Rotate the envelopes to the next group.
- After each team has had the opportunity to categorize the content from a few envelopes, ask teams to share their results. Compare with the key and resolve any disagreements.

### 4) Creating a progression of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom.
- In the same groups, ask students to create their own example of data, information, knowledge, and wisdom for a real-world scenario.  
- First, the group must select a real-world scenario in which they know about data that is collected and can speculate on how it can be used.  
- Students should record their examples.

# Teaching Tip  
The term 'insight' is frequently used in the College Board Curriculum Framework. We assume in this unit that insight is at the same level as 'knowledge'. While insight is not the same as knowledge, it lies between information and Wisdom.
[/tip]


## Wrap-up (10 min)
### 5) Summarizing and sharing
- Instruct students to trade envelopes with another group and attempt to order the items in the pyramid. Invite students share their examples of the progression from data to wisdom.


## Checking for Understanding
- What is the difference between data and information? Give an example. 
- What is the difference between information and knowledge? Give an example. 
- What is the difference between knowledge and wisdom? Give an example. 


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Asking Questions  
- Imagine you wanted to gain wisdom by collecting and analyzing data on an important school or community issue. Most meaningful data explorations start with meaningful questions or problems to resolve. What topic would you like to study? What question or problem do you want to answer? What data would you collect or search for? What would you do with the data that would help you answer your question? 



## Connections and Background Information

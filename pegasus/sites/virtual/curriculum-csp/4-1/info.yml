title: The Data Pyramid
description: "Students are surrounded by data.  How is it generated? What does it include? How can it be used? Why is it important to know about it? These questions will be explored in Unit 4.  In this lesson, students ground their understanding of data and its usefulness through  a graphical representation called the Data Pyramid. This progression, from data to information to knowledge to wisdom provides students a mental framework for rest of the unit.

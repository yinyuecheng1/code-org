## Lesson Overview (Creative)
In Lesson 1, students designed bit-sending devices. In this lesson they will create, test, and revise their devices. An important element in this lesson is for students to critically evaluate their devise and work to solve problems. It is likely that students will face challenges. Work with them to see these as learning opportunities and a fun part of the process.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Build and test bit-sending devices.
- Identify problems and revise the devices. 
- Demonstrate the devices to other groups. 

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- A collection of "bit-sending supplies"

### For the Teacher
- A large community-collection of "bit sending supplies" such as small flashlights, noise makers, bells, whistles, cups and string, tape, wire, Slinky, LEGOSÂ®, colored paper, and other common items that students can select from.
- A place to store these supplies that is accessible to students.
- Optional: A separate box of supplies for each student team. 

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Review the challenge from the previous lesson.

Review the challenge and clarify outcomes. Assist students who may need additional help with their design. If there is enough time, discuss the previous day's assessment questions.

# Teaching Tip  

Set up a system in your class for how one partner will work when the other is not in class that day. Encourage them to create a system to share documents and ideas, and to update each other on what was missed when one is absent.

## Activity: Create bit-sending Devices (25 min)  

### 2) Construct the devices.

- Supervise as students build their devices using the available supplies and following their design plans. 
- Testing and revising should be part of the process. 
- Throughout the class period, make quick visits to each team to ensure they are on task and to answer questions. 

## Activity: Demonstrate Bit-sending Devices (10 min) 

### 3) Demonstrate devices.

As two groups are finished building and testing their devices, each team can demonstrate its device to the other. If all teams finish their construction before the end of the allotted time, invite a group or two to demonstrate to the class. 

## Wrap-up (10 min) 
### 4) Summarize student learning.

If there is time, lead a class discussion of the design-build-refine process. Begin the discussion with: 

  - What challenges did your team experience? 
  - How did you meet the challenges? 
 
Alternately, these questions can be assigned as a journal entry.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Evaluating Devices
- Establish criteria to evaluate a bit-sending device. Which criteria would be most important? Rank the criteria in order of importance.

### Sending Messages Farther
- Redesign: How could you modify your bit-sending device to double the distance that the message could be communicated? Is there a limit to the distance a message can be sent using your device? 

### Writing a User Manual
- Write a set of directions to explain how to use your bit-sending device. Ask someone who doesn't know how to use the device to attempt to use it following your directions. Revise the directions to correct any misunderstandings. For an added challenge, create the directions using only images. Ask someone who doesn't know how to use the device to attempt to use it following these wordless directions. Did the user understand these directions better or worse than those with words?


## Assessment Questions
- What challenges did you face in building your bit-sending device? How did you solve them? 
- Can you send different kinds of information with your device? List three. 
- Create directions to explain to someone else how to use your device. Evaluate your communication skills. Revise as necessary.


## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives

2.1.1 Describe the combination of abstractions used to represent data.  
2.1.2 Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.  
2.2.2 Use multiple levels of abstraction in computation.  


### Other standards 

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

Computational Thinking

- 3B-7. Discuss the interpretation of binary sequences in a variety of forms.

*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.  
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.  
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.  
- 6. Attend to precision.

## Lesson Objectives 

The students will... 

- Declare a variable in JavaScript.
- Use JavaScript to display information within a web page. 
- Use JavaScript to input information from a user from a web page.
- Identify hardware devices that perform input and output functions on a computer.

## Materials, Resources and Prep 

### For the Students 

- *First JavaScript Program*  (*firstTry.html*)
- *Student Activity Guide: First JavaScript Program* 
- *Student Activity Guide: Practice Output Exercises*
- *Student Activity Guide: Bios* DOES THIS WORKSHEET NAME MAKE SENSE?

### For the Teacher 

 - *Teacher Presentation: Output in JavaScript*  

# Teaching Guide 

## Getting Started (15 min) 

1) Try a JavaScript program 
- Guide students to download and run the *FirstTry.html* JavaScript program. 
- Instruct them to record their learning by completing the *Student Activity Guide: First JavaScript Program*.

## Activity: Practicing new skills (30 min) 

### 2) Guided practice: Output in JavaScript 

- Guide students through each lab exercise using the *Teacher Presentation: Output in JavaScript*. 
- Stop the presentation between problems to demonstrate the correct code and help students correct their own code.  

### 3) Independent Practice: Output in JavaScript 

- Instruct students to independently complete exercises on the *Student Activity Guide: Practice Output Exercises*. 
- Use the challenge problem at the end of the activity to challenge those students who complete the work more quickly.

## Wrap-up (5 min) 

### 4) Journal entry 
- Think about all of your experiences using computing machines. List at least four devices used to input information into computing machines. 

### 5) The hardware connection**
- Assign students to complete the *Student Activity Guide: Bios*

# Teaching Tip
 
It can be a classroom management challenge to engage student who finish their work before most of the other students in the classroom. A collection of "challenge problems" for each unit can provide productive activities. They allow students to delve more deeply into the topics being covered and provide time for the teacher to work more closely with the students that may need extra support as they learn to code.

## Extended Learning
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

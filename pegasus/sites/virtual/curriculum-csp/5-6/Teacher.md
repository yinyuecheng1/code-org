## Lesson Overview (New learning)
Students know about and understand innovations in entertainment, sometimes more than their teachers. However, they may not understand how these innovations raise legal and ethical concerns. Students may need some direction to look beyond the initial impacts of having music, movies, books, and software readily and 'freely' available. 

After students identify innovations in entertainment, they are asked to create a list of the  initial and secondary impacts of those innovations. Putting their ideas about the impacts in writing helps students to see beyond their initial enjoyment of the innovation, provides practice in examining societal impacts, and serves as another scaffold step in preparation for the practice performance task at the end of this unit.  

The legal and ethical questions and concerns may arise in discussions about student-identified impacts. Their concerns are formally discussed and debated at the end of the lesson.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- [Student Activity Guide: Innovations in Entertainment](resources/U5_L6_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf) 	

### For the Teacher
- Background reading [*How Stuff Works:Bit Torrent*](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/bittorrent.htm)
- Background reading [*Blown to Bits* - Chapter 6](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter6.pdf)
- Background reading [*RIAA FAQ* list](http://www.riaa.com/faq.php)
- Background reading [*Why I Stopped Pirating and Started Paying for Media*](http://lifehacker.com/5990525/why-i-stopped-pirating-and-started-paying-for-media)


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Brainstorming: Innovations in entertainment.
- Distribute the Student Activity Guide.
- Read the directions. Check for student understanding.
- Instruct students to make a list of innovations in entertainment
- Start by suggesting a list of digital entertainment: music, movies, books, software
- Ask students to list the different ways they can access these items.

## Activity: Initial and Secondary Impacts (10 min)
### 2) Examining initial and secondary impacts
- Instruct students to list the initial impacts of each innovation in column 2 and the secondary impacts in column 3.
- Innovations in digital media have dramatically **changed how we obtain, store, and share digital media**. These would be initial impacts. 
- Ready access to digital media by consumers has dramatically **changed the industries that produce and distribute these media**. This would be a secondary impact.
- The goal of asking students to complete the chart is to help them see that computing innovations have impacts beyond the initial uses of the innovation.
- This concept and the ability to separate initial and secondary impacts are essential aspects of the Performance Task. In this activity, students are focusing on digital media to help them develop the ability to look beyond their own immediate perspective.

## Activity: Legal and Ethical Concerns of Sharing (30 min)
### 3) Understanding copyright law in regards to digital media.
- Conduct a teacher-led explanation of copyright law in regards to digital media.
- Chapter 6 in *Blown to Bits* (http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter6.pdf)provides an overview of copyright law.
- Based on the list students generated and using media and sites that your students are familiar with, explain how and why illegal downloading sites are violating the law.

### 4) Class debate.
- Organize a class debate of the legal and ethical concerns of sharing digital media.
- Here is a suggestion if you do not have a process for setting up a class debate. 
 - Based on student responses leading up to this point of lesson, choose a question to pose to the class that may evoke different responses.  
 - A sample question might be "Should websites that share copyrighted files be taken down?"
 - Create your own question that matches student interests.
 - If possible, divide the classroom and direct students to sit on opposite sides of the room according to their viewpoint.
 - You may want to alternate between calling on students who want to make a comment in favor and those who are against.
 - An interesting twist to the activity is to ask students to debate the side of the issue they do not personally agree with. This is typical of how debate teams are structured - personal opinion is not necessarily the side expressed in the debate.

# Teaching Tip  
Class debates can be a fun way to allow every student's voice to be heard. At the start of the debate, you may want to remind your students that they should keep their comments on topic and be sure to keep their comments objective and based upon facts rather than personal. One sign of a great debate is that students are still talking about the issue as they leave the classroom. 

[/tip]

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 5) Class vote:  Will you (continue to) participate in online sharing? 
- Pose the question to class verbally.  
- Responses can be in writing, with a show of hands, or perhaps a secret ballot or a commitment made in their journals.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Read more about it

[Chapter 6](http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter6.pdf) in the book *Blown to Bits* discusses the history and issues around the legal and ethical concerns of sharing digital media. Prepare a summary of the main points of this reading.  

### Research how Bit Torrent Works

Bit Torrent is a protocol for exchanging digital files in a distributed network. Research how Bit Torrent works and prepare to explain your findings to the class. 

### Research Creative Commons

According to their web site, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) is a nonprofit organization that "works to increase the amount of creativity.....that is available to the public for free and legal sharing, use, repurposing, and remixing." Research how to obtain a Creative Commons license and prepare to explain your findings to the class in the form of a "How To" manual. 

## Assessment Questions
- List the initial and secondary impacts of an innovation in entertainment.
- Explain the main concepts of copyright law as it applies to digital media.

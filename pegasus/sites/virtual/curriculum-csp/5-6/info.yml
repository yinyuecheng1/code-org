title: Innovations in Entertainment - Legal and Ethical Concerns
description: "Students know about and understand innovations in entertainment, sometimes more than their teachers. However, they may not understand how these innovations raise legal and ethical concerns. Students may need some direction to look beyond the initial impacts of having music, movies, books, and software readily and 'freely' available. 

After students identify innovations in entertainment, they are asked to create a list of the  initial and secondary impacts of those innovations. Putting their ideas about the impacts in writing helps students to see beyond their initial enjoyment of the innovation, provides practice in examining societal impacts, and serves as another scaffold step in preparation for the practice performance task at the end of this unit.  

The legal and ethical questions and concerns may arise in discussions about student-identified impacts. Their concerns are formally discussed and debated at the end of the lesson.

# Unit 3 Programming 

In Unit 3, students dive into programming in JavaScript. They will gain skills in four basic “Tools of Programming”: Interacting with the **User, Calculating, Making Decisions**, and **Repeating**. 

These four tools form the basis for programming and are combined in various ways to solve problems. In the beginning, students are   given small simple problems to solve. The next steps develop their skills with more and more challenging strategies and problems. All of their learning prepares them as they advance towards the final project, a stop-motion animation movie.  

### Interacting with the User  
Lessons (1-4) focus on interacting with users introduce the concepts of input and output in the context of coding. Students start with ready-to-use examples and are asked to make changes to the code. The teacher then guides them through guided practice  portion of the activity which sets them up to work independently on several practice sets. By the end of this series of lessons focused on interacting with the users, students should be comfortable with input and output, declaring variables, and data types.

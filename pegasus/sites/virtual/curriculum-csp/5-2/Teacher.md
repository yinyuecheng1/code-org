# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- Access to the article [The Flight From Conversation](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/22/opinion/sunday/the-flight-from-conversation.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0)

### For the Teacher
- None



## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Venn diagram: F2F and digital communication.
- Instruct students to draw two intersecting circles (a Venn diagram) in their journal. Label one circle F2F (Face-to-Face) Conversation and label the other Digital Conversation.
- Ask students to list descriptions/uses/traits/examples in each of the three areas of the Venn diagram: F2F, Digital, the intersection of the two. Try to include two phrases in each of the three sections.  
- As an example, in the intersection space, students might list common uses that apply to both: "ask questions", "make plans", "ask someone out", "argue"

## Activity: Beneficial and Harmful Effects (35 min)
### 2) Flight from Conversation.
- Instruct students to conduct an Internet search for "Sherry Turkle Flight from Conversation."
- Read the article, "The Flight from Conversation," aloud as a class with a strategy that works with your students.
- At two or three points during the reading, pause and ask the class what they think about the just-read section.  
- Engage them in critically thinking about the ideas expressed.

# Teaching Tip:  
Reading aloud as a class is a good way for students to practice their  reading and listening skills. You may want to read the entire passage, ask volunteers to read sections, or rotate from student to student around the room (allowing students to decline if they wish). From time to time, model reading skills for the class such as sounding out words, looking up meanings of certain words, or pausing to reflect on a certain passage. Make this an enjoyable activity and thank each student after they read.

### 3) Whip-around: The beneficial and harmful impacts of digital communication.
- Conduct a class whip-around strategy. In a whip-around, the teacher calls on students in rapid succession to give short answers.
- Ask the class, "What are some beneficial and  harmful effects of digital communication? Raise your right hand to contribute a harmful impact, your left hand to contribute a benefit."
- Alternate calling on students who want to give a beneficial and a harmful effect.
- After everyone in the class has had a chance to give a quick response, ask if there are any students who want to elaborate on any of the short responses.
- Prompt more discussion by asking students to describe how they have seen their peers abuse digital communication or the negative impacts digital communications have had on relationships.
- You might consider asking a student to list or summarize points as they are being made with the white board or other means of display.



## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 4) Resolutions: Digital conversations.
- Engage students in making resolutions about their use of digital communication technology and digital conversations.
- They can write the resolution in their journal or on class discussion website.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Research Social Media and the Arab Spring
Social Media can not only affect interpersonal relationships, it can augment political action.  Locate articles or videos about how social media impacted the 'Arab Spring' or other political movements. Share a video link or article with your class and be prepared to give a short explanation. You may want to consider this web site for background reading [Huffington Post:  Social Media and the Arab Spring](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tag/social-media-arab-spring/)

title: Compression
description: "In this lesson, students will describe some of their own experiences downloading files to illustrate and motivate the need for compression techniques. After clarifying how big gigabytes, terabytes, and petabytes are, they will learn a formula for calculating the space savings from a theoretical compression and one on their desktop.  A CS Unplugged activity will guide the students to compression an image  by hand. And extended learning activity involves learning more about various compression algorithms.

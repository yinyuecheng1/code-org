## Lesson Overview (New learning)
Throughout this course, students have examined the deep and wide impacts of computing innovations. While societal trends impact innovation, innovations also influence and change society in many ways. Much has written over the years about the digital divide - the differing access to computing and the Internet based on socioeconomic, geographic, and other factors. And while the creators of technology have hoped to change the world, those changes can sometimes magnify inequities, as well as increase equity across groups. 

In this lesson, students will discuss how inequities in society are impacted by technological innovations. They will practice their research skills by searching for authoritative resources on the web that illustrate how innovations can both reduce and magnify inequities. This knowledge will be valuable when students choose an innovation for the practice performance task at the end of this unit.

Several articles are listed in this lesson for class reading and discussion. The teacher may wish to select other readings for the lesson to meet the needs and interest of their students.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Access to the article by Joanna Goode [Digital divide changing but not for students torn by it](https://uonews.uoregon.edu/archive/news-release/2010/4/digital-divide-changing-not-students-torn-it)
- Access to the article by Jaron Lanier in [Wired Magazine](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/04/ideas-bank/the-online-utopia-doesnt-exist)
- Access to the article published in Health Education Research [Health Education and the Digital Divide](http://her.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/5/527.full?pagewanted=all)
- Access to the article [Computer and Internet Use in the United States](http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/p20-569.pdf)
- Access to the web site World Economics Forum [Networked Readiness Index 2014](http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-information-technology)
- Access to the article by Mark Zuckerberg [A Future Where the Internet is Available to All](http://online.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-on-a-future-where-the-internet-is-available-to-all-1404762276)



### For the Teacher
- Prepare for discussions by previewing student resources and the background reading listed.
- Background reading by Jaron Lanier in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/09/opinion/sunday/fixing-the-digital-economy.html)
- Background reading by the World Economic Forum [Global Information Technology Report](http://reports.weforum.org/global-information-technology-report-2014/). The Executive summary and the Networked Readiness Index Rantings are particularly useful in thinking about technological inequities.


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Observation of technological inequalities.
- Instruct students to respond in their journal: List three technological inequalities in our society that you have observed or heard about.

## Activity: Learning about Inequality (10 min)
### 2) Overview of inequality in society.
- Share what you learn from the readings and resources.
- Summary:
 - There are several ways that inequality appears among groups in a society such as gender, race, income, and geography. 
 -  Elements of society that are impacted by computing innovations include  health, education, and civic participation (and many more).
 - By pairing one aspect of society (e.g. education) with one grouping of people (e.g. by race or income), teachers can help students frame their arguments about how an innovation affects society. 
- Pose the question: "How has technical innovations impacted the equity of education for poor Americans (or other group) compared to wealthier Americans?"
- Guide teams of students to pair other societal groups with an innovation to examine the equity impact of the technology across several groups.

### 3) Optional class reading.
- Instruct students to read the article by Jaron Lanier in Wired Magazine [The Online Utopia Doesn't Exist](http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2013/04/ideas-bank/the-online-utopia-doesnt-exist). Alternately, the article could be read aloud in a round-robin strategy.
- Another article on the list above may be used as an alternate choice or  locate a different article on the topic.
- To make time for this optional class reading, the teacher may choose to reduce the time on any of the following activities in this lesson, drop the activities, or assign the activities as homework assignments.

## Activity: Researching Innovation and Inequality (20 min)
### 4) Online research.
- Direct students to find two articles from reputable websites. The articles should reflect different perspectives in regard to the effect of innovation on equity.
- One article should argue/illustrate how technological innovations have increased equity among people. 
- One article should argue/illustrate how technological innovations magnifying inequality.
- Students may find an article that discuss both sides of this issue.

### 5) Sharing resources.
- This is one suggestion from a variety of sharing strategies that can be used.
- Create three separate electronic discussion boards or shared documents to list links to articles that: 
 - argue/illustrate how technology magnifies inequality.
 - argue/illustrate how technology reduces inequity.
 - argue/illustrate how technology both reduces and magnifies inequalities.
- Ask students to post links to their articles on the appropriate board or list.

# Teaching Tip  
The purpose of this lesson is to help students research the issue of computing innovations and inequality, not to debate it. If students get into a debate, encourage them to focus on researching articles that support their perspective rather than arguing with other students. However, remind students that they must to be able to explain BOTH beneficial and harmful effects of computing innovations.

[/tip]


## Activity: Exploring Global Differences in Technology Access (10 min)
### 6) Investigating the World Economics Forum Networked Readiness Index
- Direct students to the World Economics Forum [Networked Readiness Index 2014](http://www.weforum.org/issues/global-information-technology)
- Guide students to write a question about the technology readiness around the world that can be answered using this data. The goal is to investigate the data tables and answer their questions.
- This activity is appropriate for team work.
- If time is available, ask for volunteers to share questions and answers.


## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 7) Class Vote:  
- Pose the question: Based upon what you have learned, do you foresee a future with more or less inequality as a result of technological innovations? 


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Further Research
Select a specific innovation. Search for articles specifically about the relationship between this innovation and inequality. 

### Resolving inequality
Brainstorm ideas on how inequalities magnified by technology could be resolved. Select a specific technology and focus on a specific aspect or geographic region of inequality.


## Assessment Questions
- List four societal groups that are prone to experience a digital divide.
- Describe inequalities that exist in our society in the area of health, education, civic participation, and income.
- Describe an instance in which computing innovations are reducing social or economic inequality.
- Describe an instance in which computing innovations are magnifying social or economic inequality.

title: Computing Innovations - Reducing or Magnifying Inequities?
description: "Throughout this course, students have examined the deep and wide impacts of computing innovations. 
While societal trends impact innovation, innovations also influence and change society in many ways. 
Much has written over the years about the digital divide - the differing access to computing and the Internet based on socioeconomic, geographic, and other factors. And while the creators of technology have hoped to change the world, those changes can sometimes magnify inequities, as well as increase equity across groups. In this lesson, students will discuss how inequities in society are impacted by technological innovations. They will practice their research skills by searching for authoritative resources on the web that illustrate how innovations can both reduce and magnify inequities. This knowledge will be valuable when students choose an innovation for the practice performance task at the end of this unit. Several articles are listed in this lesson for class reading and discussion. The teacher may wish to select other readings for the lesson to meet the needs and interest of their students.

title: A/B Testing
description: "Data is collected from website users all the time, often without their knowledge. One example of gathering user data is in A/B testing. In A/B testing, two different versions of a website are randomly selected to be presented to user. Data is gathered on the behaviors of thousands or maybe millions of users on the two versions. The information generated from the click-rates of each group is used to gain knowledge about the users and to drive decisions for future iterations of the website.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Data is collected from website users all the time, often without their knowledge. One example of gathering user data is in A/B testing. In A/B testing, two different versions of a website are randomly selected to be presented to user. Data is gathered on the behaviors of thousands or maybe millions of users on the two versions. The information generated from the click-rates of each group is used to gain knowledge about the users and to drive decisions for future iterations of the website.

2) Read about A/B testing of Facebook news feeds.

### **Activity: Designing an A/B Test** - 20  minutes  
3) Collaboratively design an A/B test.

### **Wrap-up** - 10  minutes 
4) Summarize and share student learning.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Define A/B testing.
- Describe how A/B testing is used on websites. 
- Design an A/B test that could be implemented on a popular website. 

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Journal
- Access to the article at Slate.com [http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/04/facebook_news_feed_edgerank_facebook_algorithms_facebook_machine_learning.html](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/04/facebook_news_feed_edgerank_facebook_algorithms_facebook_machine_learning.html)

### For the Teacher
- Background Reading, Wikipedia A/B Testing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing)
- Background Reading MIT Technology Review [http://www.technologyreview.com/news/523671/seeking-edge-websites-turn-to-experiments/](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/523671/seeking-edge-websites-turn-to-experiments/)

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Journal Prompt "Have you ever logged onto a website and noticed that it looks different from the last time you visited? How was it different? What might explain the change?"

## Activity: Learning about Facebook Testing (15 min)
### 2) Read about A/B testing of Facebook news feeds.

- Read [http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/04/facebook_news_feed_edgerank_facebook_algorithms_facebook_machine_learning.html](http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/04/facebook_news_feed_edgerank_facebook_algorithms_facebook_machine_learning.html)
- Discuss as a class. 
 - What data does Facebook gather?
 - What is data-drive decision-making?
 - How does Facebook turn that data into information? Into knowledge? Into wisdom?
 - Are there any moral concerns about this type of testing?


## Activity: Designing an A/B Test (20 min)
### 3) Collaboratively design an A/B test.

- Place students into groups of 4.
- Instruct groups to choose a favorite social media site.
- Next, each group will devise a question that they would like to answer about the user experience on that site.
- Distribute larger pieces of paper for students to complete this assignment (display later).
- Guide each group to design an A/B test that could be implemented on the website.
- Ask students to submit a layout design sketch of both test states and a rationale as to why they think the choices of users on the two designs would indicated something meaningful. 
 - What information do they think they could generate with the data? 
 - What knowledge could they gain? 
 - Is there any wisdom that they might generate?

## Wrap-up Reflection (5 min)
### 4) Summarize and share student learning.
- Invite teams to share their ideas for A/B testing.
- Display posters of student work.

## Checking for Understanding
- What is A/B Testing?  Give an example. 
- Why would some people be offended by an A/B Test? 

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Make a Video
- Make a video or screencast to communicate what you learned about A/B testing.  

### Stage a Debate
- Organize a debate about the ethics of A/B testing. One team of students can role play a large media website company and another team can role play a consumer advocacy group.

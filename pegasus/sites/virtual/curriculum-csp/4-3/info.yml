title: Big Data
description: "Big Data has been defined in many different ways. One thing that everyone agrees on is that easy access to large sets of data is changing how people make decisions. Students will explore how Big Data can be used to solve real-world problems in their community. After watching a video that explains how Big Data is different from how we have analyzed and used data in the past, students will explore Big Data techniques in online simulations.

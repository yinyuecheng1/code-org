## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Big Data has been defined in many different ways. One thing that everyone agrees on is that easy access to large sets of data is changing how people make decisions. Students will explore how Big Data can be used to solve real-world problems in their community. After watching a video that explains how Big Data is different from how we have analyzed and used data in the past, students will explore Big Data techniques in online simulations.

- Access to the Big Data video at the Economist Magazine [http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/05/kenneth-cukier-big-data](http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/05/kenneth-cukier-big-data)
- Background Reading: Wired Magazine - The Petabyte Age [http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory](http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory)
- Background Reading:  Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Ngram_Viewer)


## Getting Started - Day 1 (10 min)
### 1) Journal Entry: If you could set up sensors throughout the school that would collect data continuously, what data would you want to collect?
- Students will use these ideas for the small group work in Activity 3.

## Activity: Solving Problems with Continuous Data (40 min)
### 2) Continuous data in the city.  
- Show the slide show *Sensors and the City* at [http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/ibm-think-city-research-exhibit/](http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/ibm-think-city-research-exhibit/)
- Explain each slide and ask students to identify how data is being used to provide insights.

# Teaching Tip
Unit 5 focuses on Innovation and its impact on society. This activity helps students think about and design innovations that can have impact. 
[/tip]

### 3) Designing data capture and visualization of our school.
- In small groups, students ask a question that can be answered through continuous data collection in regards to their school.  
- Using the IBM Exhibit as a model, ask students to imagine that Data Walls could be set up in your school. The Data walls would visualize some data that is being collected continuously in the school.
- Working in groups of four, guide students to consider some questions that could be answered through continuous data collection.  
- Ask students to record the question, the data that would be collected, how it would be collected, specifically what and where it would be visualized.
- If time, have groups share their work with the class.
- This activity could be done with labeled drawings.

# Teaching Tip
This lesson is designed for two days. At the end of Step 3 would be a good place to end the first day. You may wish to add a summary activity and then start the next day with a short review activity.

## Activity: Understanding Why Big Data is Different - Day 2 (40 min)  

### 4)*The Data Revolution* A video from The Economist
  
- View the video at the Economist Magazine [http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/05/kenneth-cukier-big-data](http://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2013/05/kenneth-cukier-big-data).

- Students should take brief notes to be used in a discussion. Assign students numbers from 1 to 9. Assign each student to be responsible for recording information from the video on a specific topic 
 - 1. Datafication
 - 2. WalMart
 - 3. Car maintenance
 - 4. Health Care
 - 5. Predicting infections
 - 6. Propensity for crime
 - 7. Credit scores
 - 8. Correlation
 - 9. Reuse of data
- After the video, conduct a class discussion on the nine topics.
- Students can complete their notes from the discussion.

### 5) Using Google's NGram Viewer  
- Guide students in exploring the Viewer. The objective is to ask a question about the relative popularity/appearance of various words over the last 100 years and use data to answer their question.
- This video on the NGram Viewer: Jean-Baptiste Michel, Erez Lieberman Aiden
*What we learned from 5 million books*, is interesting and engaging. It can be used if there is available time [https://www.ted.com/playlists/56/making_sense_of_too_much_data](https://www.ted.com/playlists/56/making_sense_of_too_much_data)

- Go to Google's NGram Viewer.
- Type in different words or phrases to see the relative popularity over time.
- Encourage students to ask a meaningful question that can be answered with this tool. Trends and current events can provide ideas.
- Sometimes interesting peaks and valleys appear in the graph that are not easily explained without a little history sleuthing. Enter the word 'influenza'.

### 6) Playing a Game against Big Data
Students will play Rock Paper Scissors against a computer that has stored the results of over 200,000 games.  

- Visit the New York Times Rock Paper Scissors game: [http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/science/rock-paper-scissors.html)
- Explain the two strategies that the computer uses. Which one is a Big Data technique? 

##  Wrap-Up (10 min)
### 7) Reflection: What community, national, or global problem do you think will be solved in the future by using Big Data? What data will need to be collected to solved the problem?

## Checking for Understanding
- What does the term Big Data mean to you?
- How are Big Data approaches different from traditional approaches to analyzing data?
- Give an example of how Big Data techniques have changed a particular field or industry.


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Big Data and Your Life
- Imagine that everything that you do every day was turned into data and made available to your parents, to the government, or to businesses. What would be good about this? What would be offensive to you? Make a short video about your life which explains the type of data that might be collected and the pros and cons of such collection.  


### Public Data about Your City or State
- Many cities and states have a website dedicated to sharing public data sets about information that they collect. Do a web search for your city or state name and "public data set." 
- If you find a data site, share the URL with your class. What is the most interesting data set on the site? 


### Search Trends are Predictors
- Explore Google's Search Trends at [http://www.google.com/trends/](http://www.google.com/trends/)
- Explain to your class how the website works. 

### More Views on Data
- Select one video from the "Making sense of too much data" collection and one video from "The dark side of data" collection [https://www.ted.com/topics/data](https://www.ted.com/topics/data). Describe what you believe to be the best balance between privacy and collecting data for the common good.

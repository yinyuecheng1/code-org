## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In this lesson, students do a hands-on investigation of how computer circuits work. 

[summary]

## Teaching Summary

### **Getting Started** – 5 minutes
1) Recalling past experiences with circuits

### **Activity: Learning about Circuits** – 35 minutes
2) Demonstration: squish circuit
3) Creating simple circuits
4) Building circuits online 

### **Wrap-up** – 10 minutes
5) Ticket out the door

[/summary]

## Lesson Objectives

The students will... 

- Explore a variety of circuit components.
- Create circuitry that models the circuitry in computers.
- Analyze problems with non-functioning circuits.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how Boolean operations are represented in electronic circuits.


# Teaching Guide

## Materials, Resources and Prep

### For the Students
- Circuit kit – which should include:
 - Commercially prepared clay such as Play-doh(tm) or home-made clay. Both conductive and non-conductive modeling clay can be made from readily available materials. Salt-based clay conducts electricity while sugar-based clay acts as an insulator. Students can use the insulator clay to prevent shorts and destruction of the LED lights.  
 - IS THERE A RECIPE SOMEPLACE FOR THESE?
 - LEDs
 - Battery Packs
 - Resistors or scraps of wire
- Access to: <a href="http://logic.ly/demo/">http://logic.ly/demo/</a> 
- *Student Activity Guide: Circuits*

### Teacher

• TBD IS THERE SOME SET UP THAT GOES WITH CREATING THESE KITS? DO THEY NEED SOME LENGTH OF WIRE ALSO...OR MAYBE THIS IS THE CLAY (I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS :-)? What about info on squish circuits? hOW WILL THE TEACHER KNOW HOW TO CREATE THIS.


## Getting Started (5 min)

### 1) Recalling past experiences with circuits
- Divide the class into groups of four students each.  
- Direct them to share with their team members their past experiences with circuits. These might include activities in other classes, hobbies, or home/work experiences.

## Activity: Learning about Circuits (35 min)

### 2) Demonstration: squish circuit
- Demonstrate to the class the steps in creating a squish circuit.
- Be sure they understand that the LED lights will be ruined if the positive and negative wires cross creating a "short". Remind them to be cautious so that they will be able to successfully complete their project.

### 3) Creating simple circuits
- Guide student group to construct a simple circuit.
- As you monitor their work, visit with each group to be sure they understand how the circuit they are creating works.
- Instruct each group to construct an "AND gate" and an "OR gate" using the kit. 
- When they succeed in getting the circuits to work, students can either take a picture or sketch the successful circuit.

### 4) Building circuits online 
- Divide each student group of 4 into teams of 2. 
- Direct them to explore the logic.ly tool by trying to duplicate the circuit they created with wires. [http://logic.ly/demo/]()
- Each team should complete the *Student Activity Guide: Circuits*

## Wrap-up (10 min)
### 7) Ticket out the door
- Each team writes a brief description of what they learned in the lesson along with any questions they have on a piece of paper (including their names), and hands it to the teacher as they leave the classroom.
- Assign students to finish the Student Activity Guide outside of class if they did not complete it during the class period.

# Teaching Tip

If you cannot get the circuit-building materials needed for this lesson, the students can complete the activities using the [http://logic.ly/demo/]() website.

## Extended Learning

Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Technological innovations have the power to change the world we live in. As students begin this unit, they will analyze the impacts of earlier technological innovations and describe how innovations impact society in areas from education and health and to politics and religion. The goal of this lesson is to help students expand from a personal perspective to a societal perspective when analyzing the impact of technology.

This lesson prepares students for the Performance Task by developing  skills to analytically examine the impact of a technology on society. Students will also practice important pre-writing strategies of organizing their ideas and examining their conclusions.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...   

 - Explain the difference between the impact that a technology can have on one's personal life and the impact it can have on society as a whole. 
- Name three different aspects of society that technology has impacted.
- Match an innovation to some aspect of society that has been affected by that innovation.
 
# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- [Student Activity Guide: Examining the Societal Impact of Innovation](resources/U5_L1_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf)	


### For the Teacher
- Background reading [Wikipedia:  Sociology Scope and Topics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociology#Scope_and_topics)


## Getting Started (5 min) 

### 1) Think-Write-Share.
- Think back to near the beginning of this course when you learned about sending bits and technological innovations related to communication. 
- Record in your journal: In addition to impacting someone's personal life, how can an innovation impact various aspects of society? 

## Activity: Impacting One's Life versus Impacting Society (15 min)
### 2) Compiling a list of societal impacts from innovations.
- Ask a few students to share their journal answers.  
- As students respond, build a list of the aspects of society they mention.  These might include Education, Health, Family, Economy and Work, Law, Politics, and Social Class. Students should add these to their journal to reference later. 

### 3) Analyzing the impact of the printing press.
- In this pre-writing activity, students will analyze the impact of the printing press on society organize their ideas.
- You may want to provide some background on the printing press by showing a picture and putting it into some historical perspective [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press)
- Direct students to the Student Activity Guide Part 1.
- As a class, discuss and fill in the rows of the table that explain the impacts of the printing press on society. Distinguish the difference between personal and societal impacts. 
- This pre-writing activity will help students throughout the unit as they explore the impact of innovations.

### 4) Evaluating: Small impact versus big impact.
- Direct students to the Student Activity Guide Part 2
- Ask students to circle the 5 innovations that they think have had the greatest impact on society and to defend their reasons.
- After a few minutes, students can compare lists with their elbow partners.
- Encourage students to reassess their choices based upon what they might have learned from their peers.

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 5) As a whole class, share out the results of the previous activity
- Instruct groups to share with another group.
- Poll the students to identify the top-three selected innovations. 

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Research An Information Innovation 
Follow the pattern introduced in this lesson to analyze another information technology innovation (something before the year 2000).  
Use the Student Activity Guide Part 3 to record your ideas.

## Assessment Questions
- Explain the difference between the impact that a technology can have on one's personal life and the impact it can have on society as a whole. 
- Name three different aspects of society that technology can impact.
- Choose one of the innovations discussed in class. Describe the innovation, identify one aspect of society it has affected, and the impact it has had on that aspect of society.

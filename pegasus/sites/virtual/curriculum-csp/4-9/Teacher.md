## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
The power of using programming strategies to analyze data lies in the ability to write a small amount of code that can handle a data set of any size. In this lesson, students will use JavaScript to count, filter, and search data. The website CodeInTheBrowser.com contains tutorials that guide students through this process with data on baby names.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 5 minutes
1) Whip-Around: "In addition to the strategy used in Lesson 8 to cluster data related to baby names, what other data manipulation or analysis related to baby names would be interesting?"

### **Activity: Code In the Browser Table Data** - 90  minutes  
2) Analyzing baby name data. 

### **Wrap-up** - 5  minutes 
4) Journal Prompt: "How would you describe the advantages of analyzing data with code over some other tools and strategies to someone who does not know anything about programming?"

## Lesson Objectives 
The student will... 

- Write JavaScript code that counts a certain instance in a data set.
- Write JavaScript code that filters a data set.
- Ask a questions of a data set and write code to answer the questions.


# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Journal
- Access to CodeInTheBrowser.org [http://codeinthebrowser.org/table-data.html](http://codeinthebrowser.org/table-data.html)

### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Whip-Around
-  "In addition to the strategy used in Lesson 8 to cluster data related to baby names, what other data manipulation or analysis related to baby names would be interesting?"
- Remind students of Lesson 8 in which they accessed the Social Security site of baby names.
- Ask students to brainstorm other ways they could process the names.
- Ask students why they could not process the information in this way on the website.

## Activity: Code In the Browser Table Data (90 min)
### 2) Analyzing baby name data.  
- Direct students to Code In the Browser [http://codeinthebrowser.org/table-data.html](http://codeinthebrowser.org/table-data.html)
- This web site was created by Nick Parlante to help students learn JavaScript and aligns with objectives in the CS Principles curriculum.
- Read through the beginning of the explanation of Baby Names and "Table Data" section, paying particular attention to words "structured", "table", "field", and "row".  
- Explain to the students that this data is only from the year 2009. The data is loaded onto the web server for this site, and the only years that appear to work are 2009 and 1990.  
- Direct students to work through "Table Code" section, completing all of the variations at the bottom of each coding sample sections, to learn how to code for each of these analytic strategies.
 -  Table Query Logic (6 variations)
 -  Starts with/ ends with
 -  Boolean Logic
 -  Table Query Exercises
- If students have time they may do the remaining exercises in the "Table Query Exercises" section or they can work on the Extended Learning Activity below.

# Teaching Tip  
This website does not keep student code. If students wish to keep their code for future use or review, suggest that they copy and paste code into a text editor or a Google document.

## Wrap-up Reflection (5 min)
### 4) Journal Prompt
- How would you describe the advantages of analyzing data with code over some other tools and strategies to someone who does not know anything about programming?

## Checking for Understanding
- Write a 'for loop' that counts the number of times a certain name appears in the Baby Names data set.
- Ask your own question of the Baby Names data that can be answered by writing code.
- Cite an example of each of these that could be learned for the baby names data base:
 - 	Data
 - 	Information
 - 	Knowledge
 - 	Wisdom
 - What kind of question can not be answered by writing code similar to the code used in this lesson? 

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Two years, two tables

- Create code that makes two different tables of data, one for the year 2009 and one for the year 1990.  Write code that compares something in the year 1990 to the year 2009. How is this information useful? How might it be used for 

## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives

- 3.1.1 Use computers to process information, find patterns, and test hypotheses about digitally processed information to gain insight and knowledge. [P4]

### Other Standards

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

- CPP.L3A-12 Describe how mathematical and statistical functions, sets, and logic are used in computation.  - CPP.L3B-07 Use data analysis to enhance understanding of complex natural and human systems.  

 

*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively. 
- 4. Model with mathematics.

## Materials, Resources, and Prep  
### For the Students
- *Student Activity Guide: Warm-up*
- *Student Activity Guide: Boolean*
- *Student Activity Guide: Wrap-up*

### For the Teacher  
- *Presentation: Logic with Boolean Statements* 


## Getting Started (10 min)

### 1) Quick Check – Simple If-else

## Activity: Expanding Logic with Boolean Statements (30 min)

### 2) Guided practice - Lab Lecture: Boolean Statements

- Direct student learning with the content in the *Presentation: Logic with Boolean Statements*.

### 3) Independent Practice: Boolean Statements 
- Instruct students to complete the activities on the *Student Activity Guide: Boolean*

##  Wrap-up (10 min)

### 4) Boolean Review
- TBD  

### 5) Connection – How computers add numbers

Assign students watch the YouTube video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBDoT8o4q004"]() as an out of class activity. They should summarize what they learned in their journal.   
IS THERE SOMETHING MORE CREATIVE TO DO WITH THIS VIDEO?

# Teaching Tips

Students often get confused when they first start with Boolean Statements. For instance, they might try: x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; &lt;= 100 
While this makes sense when humans speak, to a computer it is ambiguous. It takes practice to remember to include the variable on both sides of the Boolean statement.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

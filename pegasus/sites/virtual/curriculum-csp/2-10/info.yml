title: Graph Algorithms - Shortest Path
description: "In this lesson, students continue to explore graph representations of maps and networks and are asked to think about the kinds of problems that can be solved with graphs. Students will explore the Single Source Shortest Path problem with a widget. The final project in this lesson is to write an algorithm for the Single Source Shortest Path problem.

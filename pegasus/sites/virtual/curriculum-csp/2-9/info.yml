title: Graphs - Minimum Spanning Tree
description: "In this lesson, students develop a language for describing algorithms on graphs. Students use the 'County Road Paving' widget to solve many instances of the same type of problem - known as the 'minimum spanning tree' problem - to see if they can find and describe patterns about how they are going about solving the problem. A major element of this lesson is learning how to articulate  human intuition as an algorithm for a computer. At the end of class, students are shown a version of Kruskal's Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree in a graph.

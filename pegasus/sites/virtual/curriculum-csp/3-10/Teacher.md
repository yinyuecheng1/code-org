## Teaching Summary

### **Getting Started** – 10 minutes

1) Quick check – simple if-statements

### **Activity: Making Decisions with If-else Statements** – 30 minutes

2) Guided practice: If-else statements  
3) Independent Practice: If-else statements

### **Wrap-up** – 10 minutes

4) Student activity: Flowchart  
5) Journal Entry – The grammar of programming

## Lesson Objectives

The students will...

- Use if-else statements in decision structures in the context of a JavaScript program.
- Use if-statements with else-if statements in more complex decision structures in the context of a JavaScript program. 

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Students

- *Student Activity Guide: Making Decisions with If-else statements*
-* Student Activity Guide: Flowchart*
- JavaScript program *else.js*

### For the Teacher

- *Presentation: If-else Statements*


## Getting Started (10 min)

### 1) Quick check – simple if-statements


Guide the students to download and run the program *else.js*.  After running it a few times, discuss with the class what the program does.

## Activity (30 min)

### 2) Guided practice: If Else Statements  

- Direct student learning with the content in the *Presentation: If-else Statements*

### 3) Independent Practice: If Else Statements
- Instruct students to complete the activities on the *Student Activity Guide: Making Decisions with If-else statements*

##  Wrap-up (10 min)

### 4) Student Activity: Flowchart

- Instruct students to complete the activities on the *Student Activity Guide: Flowchart*.

### 5) Journal Entry – Grammar of Programming

- Instruct students to respond to the following prompt in their journals as an outside of class activity:  

When you write a letter or a book report, you follow certain rules of grammar - commonly accepted formats that enable others to better understand what you are trying to communicate. Computer programming code also has rule of grammar. The grammar  does not change how the computer interprets code, but it can make it much easier for others to understand what is being communicated.

List a few grammar “rules” of coding that you have noticed in the programs you have seen in this course.

# Teaching Tip

As students develop skills in working with if-else commands, pay special attention to how they are formatting the code. This is part of the grammar of programming. Correct indentation makes code much easier to read and debug. While the computer does not rely on indentation styles to correctly compile and execute code, indenting is one of the many ways we structure code to make it easier for ourselves and other team members to read and understand.

## Extended Learning
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Ternary Operator

JavaScript, like many languages includes the use of the ternary operator. This is a simplified way of making a decision in code. 
The format of the ternary operator looks like:

var x = 19;  
(x &lt; 20) ? x++ : x--;  
document.writeln(x);  

This particular sample adds 1 to x if it is less than 20,  otherwise it subtracts 1.

While this may be difficult for most beginning programming students, you may have a few students who finish early and would benefit from the additional challenge of creating short programs using the ternary operator.

## Lesson Overview (New learning)
In  Lesson 3, students explored how computing innovations can enhance human abilities. In this lesson, they will learn how technology and solutions that scale can enhance our abilities to solve larger and broader problems. The lesson begins by examining reCAPTCHAs, something that most students will be familiar with, but they may not realize how it solves two significant problems. 

Student will see how computers are used to aggregate the computational power of individuals to solve large-scale problems through citizen science activities and participate in a citizen science project. Aggregate problem-solving is sometimes called 'crowd sourcing.' For a bit of fun with this concept, students will play an on-line game that uses aggregated, human-entered data to guess what users are thinking about. On the second day of this lesson(optional), students will edit a Wikipedia page to add their expertise to the store of knowledge available to everyone.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Access to the website [Bird Color Challenge](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/labs/applications/colors/Gecko_Default.aspx)
- Access to the article [Crowdsourcing, For the Birds](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/crowdsourcing-for-the-birds.html?pagewanted=all)
- Access to the website [Akinator.com](http://en.akinator.com/) or [20Q](http://20q.com/)

### For the Teacher
- Access the video  [Fight Spam and Save Shakespeare](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/)to show to the class


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Think-Pair-Share:  Solving problems with reCAPTCHA
- Show an image of a reCAPTCHA (by visiting a website that employs this technology or from an image search)
- Direct students to describe for their elbow partner when and where they have encountered this on the web and discuss why it is used. 
- View the video [Fight Spam and Save Shakespeare](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) and discuss:
 - 	What two problems are being solved with reCAPTCHA?
 - 	How has reCaptcha used the aggregate computing power of millions of people to solve problems in digitizing of old books?
 - 	Have you heard of other aggregate solutions to problems that are currently being solved?
 - 	Are there other problems you can think of that a strategy of capturing the work of millions of people and their computers might be able to solve?

## Activity: Citizen Science (20 min)
### 2) Learn about tracking birds with citizen science.
- As a class, read the article [Crowdsourcing, For the Birds](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/20/science/earth/crowdsourcing-for-the-birds.html?pagewanted=all)
- Discuss with the class the components of citizen science:  
 - A problem to be solved.
 - A way for people to participate.
 - A website or app to aggregate data.
 - A way to turn the data into knowledge.
- Ask students if they know of other citizen science projects. A quick Internet search will turn up dozens...maybe some in your locale.
- Engage students in a discussion of problems that they think a citizen science project could address using computers to harness the power of data from many individuals. 

### 3) Participate in citizen science.
- Direct students to the site [Bird Color Challenge](http://www.allaboutbirds.org/labs/applications/colors/Gecko_Default.aspx)
- Ask students to read the web site to find the purpose of the game.  
- Allow students to play several times.
- As a class, briefly discuss how the student responses will help scientists.


## Activity: Guessing What You are Thinking (15 min)
### 4) Play an on-line game which aggregates human information.
- Direct students to [Akinator.com](http://en.akinator.com/) or [20Q](http://20q.com/).
- After the students have played the game once, ask them to enter some information into the game.
- Discuss how the game acts intelligently.

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 5) Summarize student learning.
- At the end of the game, students are asked to enter more information into the game.  
- Instruct them to take a screen shot of the page after they have entered information and save it to their computer.
- Verify that students participated by asking them to either print the screen shot image or email it to you as an attachment. 

## Optional Day 2 (50 minutes)
### 6) Add knowledge to Wikipedia.
The purpose of this activity is for students to contribute their knowledge to the aggregated collection of knowledge known as "Wikipedia." Divide the class into teams of two. Instruct students to think of topics they have some knowledge of: a sport, music, their community, a hobby, or other expertise. Direct them to explore the content on that topic on Wikipedia. Each team should work independently to learn how to modify a Wikipedia page and then add some content to the topic. Encourage students to be independent learners by working to learn how to make edits with as little help as possible from the teacher.  

At the end of class summarize student learning through a discussion or by summarizing the steps of the Wikipedia editing process in their journals.  Additionally, students could collaboratively write a paragraph about how they worked together to complete the task. 


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Learn about Kickstarter
Direct students research Kickstarter.com. Ask them to choose a current project that they think is worthy of funding and justify that judgment. Suggest that the students think of a project that they would like to see as a good candidate for Kickstarter.

### Use Search Trends as Predicators
Ask students to learn about how search trends can be used as predicators. They should share what they learned with class by any creative means.

### More Citizen Science 
Find a citizen science project that is of interest to you. Participate in the project. Report your experiences in any creative format: a report, a diorama, a website, video, etc.

## Assessment Questions
- Explain the dual purposes of a reCAPTCHA
- Explain how people add value to  citizen science projects using several examples.
- Explain how people add value to an on-line guessing game.

title: Problem Solving that Scales
description: " In  Lesson 3, students explored how computing innovations can enhance human abilities. In this lesson, they will learn how technology and solutions that scale can enhance our abilities to solve larger and broader problems. The lesson begins by examining reCAPTCHAs, something that most students will be familiar with, but they may not realize how it solves two significant problems. 

Student will see how computers are used to aggregate the computational power of individuals to solve large-scale problems through citizen science activities and participate in a citizen science project. Aggregate problem-solving is sometimes called 'crowd sourcing.' For a bit of fun with this concept, students will play an on-line game that uses aggregated, human-entered data to guess what users are thinking about. On the second day of this lesson(optional), students will edit a Wikipedia page to add their expertise to the store of knowledge available to everyone.

<h1>Teaching Guide</h1>

<h2>Materials, Resources and Prep</h2>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>· Independent Practice Problems on Modular Division</p>

<h3>Teacher</h3>

<p>· Presentation: Notes on Modular Division </p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>Getting Started – 15 minutes</h3>

<p>1) Adding Time – Think, pair, share</p>

<p>Give the students the following scenario – it is currently 11:40 AM. What time will it be 4 hours and 37 minutes from now?</p>

<p>Once they have an answer share it with their elbow partner. Have the pairs write out an algorithm to solve the problem for any two times, not just the two listed.</p>

<p>Have the pairs form groups of four. The groups should discuss how they would write a program to solve this problem. How would they enter data? Write an algorithm to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Have the groups swap algorithms and test for accuracy.</p>

<h3>Activity – 25 minutes</h3>

<p>2) Presentation: Notes on Modular Division and Random Numbers</p>

<p>3) Independent Practice Problems </p>

<h3> Wrap-up – 5 minutes</h3>

<p>4) Modular Division – Check for understanding</p>

<p>On a scrap of paper have the students try:</p>

<p>13 % 5</p>

<p>14 % 5</p>

<p>15 % 5</p>

<p>16 % 5</p>

<p>17 % 5</p>

<p>18 % 5</p>

<h3>Homework</h3>

<p>5) Journal Response – Data Types and Modular Division</p>

<p>Have the students respond – In JavaScript can you do modular division on decimal numbers? Why?</p>

<p>How could you test your idea?</p>

<h2>Teaching Tips</h2>

<h3>JavaScript and Data Types</h3>

<p>Unlike other computer languages JavaScript is not strongly types. This means that it is not as finicky about the data type of numbers as it does calculations. If you are familiar with other languages like Java you are probably used to a lot of errors when dealing with things like integers and decimal values. Since JavaScript [/tip]</p>


THIS PART OK FORMAT-WISE

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.


### EXAMPLE Longer Distances
How could you modify your bit-sending machine to double the distance that the message can be can communicated? Is there a limit to the distance a message can be sent using your device? 


## EXAMPLE Assessment Questions
- What were the challenges you faced in building your machine?  How did you solve them? 
- Can you send different kinds of information with your machine. List three. 
- Write a set of directions to explain to someone else how to use your machine.


## CS Principles Learning Objectives


- 5.5.1 Employ appropriate mathematical and logical concepts in programming. [P1]


The activities in Lesson 1 support CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards:

 - ??

Other standards from the Common Core Mathematics and Language Arts

## Lesson Overview (Assessment)

This lesson is designed for two class meetings. Student understanding will be assessed through a lab project in which they will demonstrate their understanding of the decision-making algorithm and code in JavaScript. During the first class period, students will begin a lab programming assignment. The second day will include a quiz on Boolean logic and statements, and provide time for them to complete the programming project.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources, and Prep
### For the Students
- *Student Activity Guide: Lab Assignment - Boolean If-statements*
- Quiz: Boolean

### For the Teacher
- TBD


## Getting Started (Day 1) (10 min)

### 1) Understanding the Lab Assignment – Boolean If-statements
Check for understanding:

- Instruct the students to independently read the *Student Activity Guide: Lab Assignment - Boolean If-statements* document
- Ask 1 or 2 students to describe what they understand the task to be.  
- Answer any questions.

## Activity: Lab Project (35 min)
### 2) Independent work on the lab assignment 
- Monitor student progress.
- Avoid answering questions directly; instead, ask the students questions that will guide them to being able to answer their own questions.
 
## Wrap-up (Day 1) (5 min)
### 3) Journal entry – Progress

- Instruct students to record their progress on the lab project in a journal entry. They should record what they have accomplished, and what their next steps will be, as well as any problems they encountered that they should research before the next class meeting.

### 4) Review for the quiz
- Assign students to review for the quiz the following day by reviewing their journal entries, Student Activity documents, projects and notes from Lessons 8-12. This is intended to be an out of class activity. 

## Getting Started (Day 2) (10 min)
### 5) Progress re-check

- Direct students to review the journal notes made at the end of the last class meeting before they begin the last phase of the project.
- Answer any questions that may pertain to the entire class. 


## Activity: Lab Project (35 min)
### 6) Quiz on Boolean
- Distribute the Quiz
- Answer any questions students have about the questions.

### 7) Independent work on the lab assignment 
- Monitor student progress.

## Wrap-up (Day 2) (5 min)
### 8) Experience summary  
- Direct students to respond to the following questions in their journals.
 - Identify one error or bug you encountered while working on the lab project. 
 - Describe the error and what you did to solve it. 
 - How can you test your program to know that to works correctly and solves the problem? 

- Assign students to complete the lab project outside of class if necessary.

# Teaching Tip
Help students to become independent learners and to look to themselves first when they have questions or problems. Develop a consistent approach to helping students; ask the students questions that will guide them to being able to answer their own questions.

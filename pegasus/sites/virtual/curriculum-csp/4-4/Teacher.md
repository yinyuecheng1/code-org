## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
As all educators and many students know, large quantities of data are continuously being collected by schools on every student. The collection, storage, maintenance, and security of this data makes an excellent case study. In this lesson, students will learn about privacy concerns related to student data and hear from school personnel about what data is collected and how it is stored, used, and secured.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Journal

### For the Teacher
- Access to this or other related content: *Mass Collection of Student Data Raises Privacy Concerns* [http://www.npr.org/2014/05/26/316110345/mass-collection-of-student-data-raises-privacy-concerns](http://www.npr.org/2014/05/26/316110345/mass-collection-of-student-data-raises-privacy-concerns)

## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) "What does your school know about you?  Where is this information stored?"
- A class discussion can be informative because it is likely that students know very little about this topic. They will have as many questions as they do answers and speculations.

## Activity: Privacy Concerns with Student Data (15 min)
### 2) Hear from experts about student data and privacy.
- One example is of an article to *Mass Collection of Student Data Raises Privacy Concerns* [http://www.npr.org/2014/05/26/316110345/mass-collection-of-student-data-raises-privacy-concerns](http://www.npr.org/2014/05/26/316110345/mass-collection-of-student-data-raises-privacy-concerns)....this is an audio file
- There may be a recent video or article that is more relevant to your district or state.
- Ask students questions to check their understanding during and after the story is presented.

# Teaching Tip  
When students listen to an article, you may need to make accommodations for students with hearing disabilities.  The website includes a transcript of the article.

## Activity: Learning about the Storage and Maintenance of Personal Student Data (25 min)
### 3) Guest speakers.
Administrator responsible for student records.

- Each school has an administrator who is responsible for the student information system who can inform the class about the data that is collected on students.
- The students could ask the administrator to fit the school's data collection system into the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom Pyramid.
- Prepare the speaker for this request ahead of time to ensure adequate preparation time.

An IT specialist responsible for storing and maintaining student records.

- It may also be helpful invite a district IT specialist to discuss how the student data is stored, maintained, transmitted, and secured.  
- This person could discus the trade-offs between having easy access and maintaining privacy. It would be informative for the students to know where their data is stored and who has access to it. 
- While computer hardware is not a major focus of this course, the IT specialist might want to show students some physical storage components, such as a server rack. 

## Wrap-up Reflection (5 min)
### 4) Journal Prompt: What policies do you think your school or your state should have in regards to student data?

## Checking for Understanding
- What information does your school collect about you that you did not know about before?
- What concerns do you have for the privacy of your school data? 
- What are some of the trade-offs involved in the storage, transmission, and security of data?

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Make a Video about Storage Media
- The choice of storage media affects both the methods and costs of manipulating the data it contains (3.3.1H). Research various ways that data is stored, either on a personal device, or on a cloud server. Be prepared to report your results to the class, either in person or in a video report.  

### What does it Mean to Store Data in the Cloud?
- Learn more about how cloud storage systems work. Prepare a diagram, video, or other artifact to communicate what you learn. 

### Supreme Court Rules on Cell Phone Searches
- The data on your cell phone is easy to access, but may not be secure. In June, 2014 the Supreme Court ruled that cell phones may not be searched by police without a warrant. Learn more about this ruling and report to the class on the details of the law as they might impact young people.

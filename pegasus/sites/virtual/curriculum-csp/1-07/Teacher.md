## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In this lesson, students will learn to convert between decimal values to binary number representations. This is a logical next-step after exploring bits. Students will experiment with three light switches and follow the teacher's lead with the Student Activity Guide. Students will better understand representing values in binary and be able to devise a conversion algorithm. The Cisco Binary Game is an engaging way to learn and practice the binary number system in an arcade game environment. It is an ideal environment to reinforce learning outside of class.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 15 minutes

1) Represent values with light switches.    

### **Activity: Convert between Binary and Decimal** - 30  minutes  

2) Design a conversion algorithm.

### **Wrap-up** - 10  minutes 
3) Cisco Binary Game.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will... 

- Describe how values can be represented in binary.
- Convert numbers between decimal and binary.
- Calculate how many bits are needed to represent integers within a certain range.



# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- [Student Activity Guide: Converting Decimal to Binary ](resources/U1_L7_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf)
- Access to a browser to play the Cisco Binary Game [http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm](http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm)

### For the Teacher
- Three lights that can be turned on and off. These can be the classroom lights or 3 flashlights.


## Getting Started (15 min)
### 1) Represent values with a light switch.
- Instruct students to answer these questions with an elbow partner:
	- Using a single light switch, how can you represent the value 0? 1? 
	- If you have two light switches, how many values can you represent? Describe how you would represent each value.
- Invite students to share their ideas.
- Engage the entire class with the following questions. Show the various combinations.
	- If I add a third switch, how many values can I represent? 
	- How many values can I represent with 4 switches? Do you notice a pattern?

# Teaching Tip
Guiding the students toward understanding that the number of switches determines how many numbers can be represented. The pattern is 1 switch = 2 (2^1) numbers, 2 switches = 4 (2^2), 3 switches = 8 (2^3), etc.

## **Convert between binary and decimal** (30 min)  
### 2) Design a conversion algorithm.
Use the *Student Activity Guide: Converting Decimal to Binary* to guide students in building an algorithm for converting binary to decimal. Answer questions as they arise or ask students to explain how they arrived at the answer to check for understanding as you progress through the activity.

- List the numbers from 0 to 15. Show students how they are represented in binary. Practice representing the grade level of various students in binary.
- Show an algorithm for converting binary to decimal. 
- Show an algorithm for converting decimal to binary. 
- Convert an IP address from decimal to binary.


## Wrap-up (5 min)
### Cisco Binary Game.
- Show students the Cisco Binary Game and invite them to use it to reinforce their learning on binary numbers. [http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm](http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm)  


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Cisco Binary Game
- Play the Cisco Binary Game. [http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm](http://forums.cisco.com/CertCom/game/binary_game_page.htm) Teach a friend how to play the game. Create a quiz to determine if the friend has learned the basics of the binary number system.


## Assessment Questions
- Why is the binary number system used in computers?
- Describe the pattern you observe for even and odd numbers in binary. Why do you think this pattern emerges?
- What other patterns do you see in binary numbers?
- Convert the ages of your family members to binary. How many bits are needed to express the ages?
- Describe an algorithm for converting decimal numbers to binary. 
- Describe an algorithm for converting binary numbers to decimal.

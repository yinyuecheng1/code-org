title: Converting Decimal into Binary
description: "In this lesson, students will learn to convert between decimal values to binary number representations. This is a logical next-step after exploring bits. Students will experiment with three light switches and follow the teacher's lead with the Student Activity Guide. Students will better understand representing values in binary and be able to devise a conversion algorithm. The Cisco Binary Game is an engaging way to learn and practice the binary number system in an arcade game environment. It is an ideal environment to reinforce learning outside of class.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)

In this two-day lesson students are introduced to the for-loop. The two days ensure both enough time to introduce the algorithm and new syntax, and for students to develop skills. In the activities, students will be creating programs that manipulate images. 

At this point it is appropriate to point out that there are generally two types of repetition in programming. In one, the user determines the number of repetitions and the programmer cannot predict how many times a process will occur. In the second, represented by the for-loop, the emphasis is on counting and the programmer can predict and control how many times the process will be repeated. Student projects include using for-loops for Chroma Key compositing to change the background color of images.

In addition to learning new skills with for-loops, students will apply skills they learned earlier related to random numbers and modular division.

## Lesson Objectives

The students will...

- Correctly implement a for-loop in the context of a JavaScript program.
- Correctly trace a for-loop to determine number of repetitions and output.
- Correctly distinguish when a for-loop is appropriate to solve a given problem.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Students

- JavaScript file: *for.js*
- *Student Activity Guide: For-loops Lab*
- *Student Activity Guide: Tracing For-Loops* 

### For the Teacher

- Create a simple program using a for-loop to create a circle in the JavaScript tool being used for this course. Name it *for.js*
- *Presentation: Repetition with For-Loops*


## Day 1: Getting Started (15 min)

### 1) Code check-up
- Guide the students to download and run the program *for.js*.  After running it a few times, discuss with the class what the program does.
-  Change it so the circle is drawn 10 times. 
-  Challenge: Use a random number to draw 10 circles at random locations on the screen.

## Activity: Repetition with For-loops (30 min)

### 2) Guided practice: For-Loop
- Direct student learning with the content in the *Presentation: Repetition with For-Loops*

### 3) Independent Practice: For-Loop Statements
- Instruct students to complete the activities on the *Student Activity Guide: For-Loops Lab*
- Monitor student progress.
- Avoid answering questions directly; instead, ask the students questions that will guide them to being able to answer their own question.

 
## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 4) Journal entry – Progress report

- Instruct students to record their progress on the lab project in a journal entry or on the *Student Activity Guide: For-Loops Lab* document. They should record what they have accomplished, and what their next-steps will be, as well as any problems they encountered that they should research before the next class meeting.

## Day 2: Getting Started  (5 min)
### 4) Journal entry - Progress report
- Instruct students to respond to the prompt: How is the for-loop different than repeating a process by clicking a button over and over? How can using a for-loop change the types of problems that can be solved?
- Follow up with any questions or problems students report on the progress report from the previous day on the *Student Activity Guide: For-Loops Lab* document or in their journals.

## Activity: For-loops continued (30 min)

### 5) Independent practice (continued)
- Monitor student progress.

## Wrap-up (15 min)

### 6) Art walk

- Instruct students to select their favorite image from the ones they created in the lesson. 
- Assign half of the class to stand by their computers.
- Direct the other students to tour the room to see their peers; work.
- Encourage them to ask questions and to ask the creator to explain how they got their results. 
- After about 5 minutes, switch student roles.
- Direct students to complete the self-assessment as directed at the bottom of the *Student Activity Guide: For-loop Lab* document.

### 7) Tracing for-loops
- Assign the *Student Activity Guide: Tracing For-loops* as  an out-of-class activity.

# Teaching Tip 
During lab activities answering questions directly; instead, ask the students questions that will lead them to answer their own questions. A classroom management technique that can be useful is to encourage students to ask at least two other students before they ask the teacher. This encourages peer-to-peer communication and cooperative support between students.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Loops in the Real-world
Keep a log of experiences in your interactions with computers and other technologies in which you think a loop of some type is being used. This might be in a drawing program, in your interactions with sites that require a password, the automatic teller machine at the bank, your phone, television, or other programmable device. Attempt to identify the type of loop algorithm used.

### Loop Skits and Songs
Create a skit or write a song to teach various looping algorithms.

### Fractured Tales
Select a favorite children's story or comic strip plot. Revise it to include looping algorithms in the plot, actions, or conversations. This is intended to be fun and a bit silly.

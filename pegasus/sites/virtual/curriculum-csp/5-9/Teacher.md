## Lesson Overview (New learning)
Over the course of this unit students have learned about various types of innovations and explored a variety of ways to think about and examine the impacts of those innovations on society. 

Using a pre-writing activity, students will create a graphic organizer to consolidate and focus their knowledge about an innovation. This activity modeling a practice performance task will help them understand how to choose another innovation for their Advanced Placement *Explore - Implications of Computing Innovations Performance Task* that meets the prescribed criteria. Practice is important because  it enables students to hone their skills and build confidence by giving and receiving feedback from teachers and peers.

- Review the knowledge they gained throughout the unit.
 
 
# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- [Student Activity Guide: Pre-Writing Activity](resources/U5_L9_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf)	
- Copy of the current CS Principles Performance Task found at [http://www.csprinciples.org/home/about-the-project](http://www.csprinciples.org/home/about-the-project).

### For the Teacher
- Background reading [Closing in on Close Reading](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/dec12/vol70/num04/Closing-in-on-Close-Reading.aspx)


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Whip-Around  
- Prompt a quick class discussion with this prompt: "Quickly state something you learned in this unit about the impact of innovations."

## Activity: Pre-writing Activity  (30 min)
### 2) Organizing ideas.
- Guide students to complete the pre-writing tasks on the Student Activity Guide.
- The pre-writing activity asks students to answer questions about a computing innovation. These questions align with the more detailed directions of the practice performance task.
- Students should be able to do most of this work independently, but may ask for clarification.
- Encourage independent work; coach as needed. The objective is to prepare  students to be entirely self-sufficient when working on the AP CSP  Exam Performance Task.


### 3) Sharing in small groups.

- Form groups of three to four students.  
- Allow each student one minute to share his answers and then one minute of follow-up for questions and comments from the other students in the small group.
- Encourage students to give constructive feedback in a positive and encouraging manner.

# Teaching Tip  
This lesson is **practice** for the AP CSP Exam Performance Task and is not intended as time for working on the actual PT. Remind students to choose a different topic for this **practice** task than the one they plan to use for the AP CSP Exam Performance Task. Practice is important because  it enables students to hone their skills and build confidence by giving and receiving feedback from teachers and peers. 

[/tip]

## Activity: Reading the Performance Task(15 min)
### 4) Practice critical reading skills.
- As a class, read through the Performance Task directions. 
- Encourage students to mark up the directions for emphasis and clarification.
- Pause frequently to help the students fully understand the directions.
- Use the background reading [Closing in on Close Reading](http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/dec12/vol70/num04/Closing-in-on-Close-Reading.aspx) for ideas of reading strategies to use as the class reads these directions.


## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 5) Check for understanding.
-  Ask if there are any questions about the practice performance task process that will begin in the next class meeting. 
-  Verify student understanding of the assignment with a question or two to be answered in an exit ticket, a journal entry, an email response, or a class discussion.


## Assessment Questions
- What did you learn about the impact of computing that you did not know before?
- Describe your ideas for mitigating the negative impacts of an innovation.

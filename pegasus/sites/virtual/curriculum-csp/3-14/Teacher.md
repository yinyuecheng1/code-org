## Lesson Overview (New Learning)

In this lesson, students will expand their skills in designing programs that make calculations. Specifically they will learn the algorithms and JavaScript code for counting and accumulating values. The programming activities are particularly engaging; students will create programs that move graphics around the screen.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources, and Prep
### For the Students
- JavaScript file: *counting.js*
- *Student Activity Guide: Counting and Accumulating*

### For the Teacher
- Create a file (JavaScript file: *counting.js*) to review counting.
- *Teacher Presentation: Counting and Accumulating*


## Getting Started (10 min)

### 1) Code checkup – Review number calculations
- Guide the students to download and run the program *counting.js*. 
- Guide students in tracing the code to review what it does. 

## Activity: Programs that Count and Add Values (30 min)

### 2) Guided practice: Counting and Accumulating
- Move object across screen in increments of 10

### 3) Independent Practice: Counting and Accumulating
- Guide students to complete the - *Student Activity Guide: Counting and Accumulating*.
- Change how object moves. 
- Challenge – move the image until it hits the edge of box  and then change direction.

##  Wrap-up (5 min)

### 4) Journal Entry

Why are counting and summation important skills in writing programs. List three programs you think use either counting or summation and explain how they use this technique.

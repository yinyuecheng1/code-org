title: CSV Files
description: "Many publicly available data sets that students will find online are in a Comma Separated Value (CSV) format. In this lesson, students will learn about the CSV format, view files in a text editor, import files into a spreadsheet, and analyze the different views. Independently, they search the web for CSV data files on topics of interest to them.

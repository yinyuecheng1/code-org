## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Many publicly available data sets that students will find online are in a Comma Separated Value (CSV) format. In this lesson, students will learn about the CSV format, view files in a text editor, import files into a spreadsheet, and analyze the different views. Independently, they search the web for CSV data files on topics of interest to them.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 5 minutes
1) Journal Prompt:  "What is a comma typically used for?"   

### **Activity: Exploring CSV Files** - 40  minutes  
2) Open CSV files in a text editor.  
3) Import CSV files into a spreadsheet.  
4) Search for interesting CSV files.


### **Wrap-up** - 5  minutes 
5) Journal Prompt: "Describe an interesting CSV file that you found?  How do you think this data might be used to generate information, knowledge, and wisdom?"

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will... 
 
- Define CSV file.
- Describe what a CSV file looks like.
- Open a CSV file in Excel or Google spreadsheet.


# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student journal
- CSV file  "Most Populous.csv" in the resources folder
- Access to Excel or Google Sheets

### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet
- Background Reading: Wikipedia [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Journal Prompt  
- "What is a comma typically used for?"  

## Activity:  Exploring CSV Files (40 min)

# Teaching Tip  
When all students open the same file in this initial step, you can quickly ensure that everyone understands the process. Students may feel more comfortable when they see that their screen matches yours. Later in this lesson, students will have a chance to explore on their own. 
[/tip]


### 2) Opening CSV files in a text editor.
- Direct students to download the file "Most Populous.csv"
- Next, direct students to open up a text editor such as TextEdit on a Mac or NotePad on Windows.
- Within the text editor, direct guide students to open up the CSV file.
- Ask students to comment on what they see and what they think it means.  

### 3) Importing CSV files into a spreadsheet.
- Now, show students how to open the file in Excel. (Practice this step before hand to know the exact steps for your version of Excel.)
- Using the same file, show students how to open it in a Google spreadsheet (File....Open File.....Upload and then navigating to the CSV file on your computer). 
- Ask students to compare and contrast the text editor's visualization of the CSV file with the spreadsheet version and to speculate on the reasons for the differences.


### 4) Searching for interesting CSV files.
- There are an incredible number of CSV files that students can find on the web.
- Direct students to perform a search with some topic that they like, followed by CSV file. An example might be "baseball csv file"
- With some practice, students will find many data sets. Allow them some time and freedom to explore.
- Other resources if needed.

## Wrap-up  (5 min)
### 5) Journal Prompt 
- "Describe an interesting CSV file that you found?  How do you think this data might be used to generate information, knowledge, and wisdom?"


## Checking for Understanding
- What do the letters CSV stand for? 
- What does a CSV file look like in the text editor? Write a short example of data in a CSV file.
- What are the differences between a text editor visualization and a spreadsheet visualization of a CSV file? 
- When and why might someone choose to view a data file in a spreadsheet program instead of in a text editor?


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Other Separators

- Commas are not the only way to separate values in a file. Research other ways to separate fields and records within data files and report back to the class.  


## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives

- 2.1.1 Describe the variety of abstractions used to represent data. [P3]
- 5.3.1 Use abstraction to manage complexity in programs. [P3]
- 5.5.1 Employ appropriate mathematical and logical concepts in programming. [P1]


### Other Standards

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

- CPP.L3A-05 Use Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and libraries to facilitate programming solutions. 
- CPP.L3A-11 Describe techniques for locating and collecting small and large-scale data sets. 


*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.

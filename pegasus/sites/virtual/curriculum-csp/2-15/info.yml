title: Sending Passwords Over the Internet
description: "In this lesson, students explore the concept of passwords as used on computers.  Many websites insist that users have passwords and that those passwords follow certain rules. Questions users might ask: Why are these rules necessary? How are passwords kept secure?  What happens to a password when you type it and send it over the Internet? 

The activity in this lesson presents the problems and difficulties of passwords in the Internet age. Students are asked to explore (and crack) simple 'classic' encryption techniques such as the Caesar substitution cipher and the 'box' transposition cipher. The idea of 'locks' and 'keys' are explored.

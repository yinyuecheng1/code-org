title: Multiple Senders and Recipients
description: "This lesson is an extension of the previous two lessons in which students designed and constructed bit-sending devices. In this lesson, students will devise protocols for sending messages to multiple recipients, demonstrate their devices to other teams, and teach other teams to use their devices to send messages.

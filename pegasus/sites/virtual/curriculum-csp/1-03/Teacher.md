## Lesson Overview (Creative)
This lesson is an extension of the previous two lessons in which students designed and constructed bit-sending devices. In this lesson, students will devise protocols for sending messages to multiple recipients, demonstrate their devices to other teams and teach other teams to use their devices to send messages.

## Teaching Summary

### **Getting Started** - 5 minutes
1) Summarize the device construction process.

### **Activity: Device Demo** - 10 minutes
2) Teach others to use the devices. 

### **Activity: Sending Messages to Others** - 30  minutes  
3) Send messages to other teams.  
4) Send messages to a large group.

### **Wrap-up** - 5  minutes 
5) Summarize student learning.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will... 

- Devise protocols for sending messages to multiple recipients.
- Solve the problems created by multiple senders and recipients.
- Summarize their learning over the past 3 days.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Bit-sending machines from the previous day
- Journal

### For the Teacher
- A place to store the bit-sending devices or a place to store the recycled parts for another time.

## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Summarizing the construction process.

Briefly discuss responses to these Assessment Questions from Lesson 2.

- What were the challenges you faced in building your machine? How did you solve them? 
- Can you send different kinds of information with your machine? List three.

## Activity: Device Demo (10 min)
### 2) Teaching others to use the devices. 

Form groups of four students by combining two teams. Each team  demonstrates its device and teaches the other team how to use it to successfully send a message. Keep the students on task for this short activity so that you have enough time for the next activities. 

## Activity: Sending Messages to Others (30 min)  
3) Send messages to other teams. 

- Each new team of four is tasked with using one of the devices from either of the original two teams to send messages to the other team across the room. Start out with two senders on one side and two receivers on the other side. Students can determine if they want to send messages both directions.  
- Suggest to the groups that they need a way to communicate  through the system (other than verbally) that another user is on the system. Ask them to imagine how this system would work if the senders and recipients were in different rooms or different buildings. 

4) Send messages to a large group.

- Select one or two message-sending devices to send a message simultaneously to everyone in the class. Discuss how one machine could be used to allow different senders to send messages to different receivers. How would you know when one message ended and another began? How would you know to whom the message was  being sent?

# Teaching Tip
Throughout the year, teachers choose students to answer questions, share ideas, or demonstrate their work. It is important to consciously select students in ways that build the confidence of all students in the class. Call upon students who are proud of their work, not just those who can contribute something that you would rate as the "best" work.

## Wrap-up (5 min) 
### 5)  Summarizing student learning.

- Engage students to summarize what they have learned in the three bit-sending lessons. They can comment on what they learned in regards to converting a message into bits, working in collaboration with others, communication skills, vocabulary, or other learning. A variety of strategies can be used; consider a class exit ticket, a journal entry, or a walk-about discussion.  


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Research: Early Telephone Systems.  
Research early telephone systems. Describe or sketch the technical design elements. How were they used? Find photos of a variety of different designs. Create a time-line with the photos. Grandparents or older adults may be good sources of information for some details. Interview and record their stories about using the early phones.

## Assessment Questions
- How do other communication devices handle the problems of multiple senders and recipients? 

## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives

2.1.1 Describe the combination of abstractions used to represent data.  
2.1.2 Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.  
2.2.2 Use multiple levels of abstraction in computation.  


### Other standards 

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

Computational Thinking

- 3B-7 Discuss the interpretation of binary sequences in a variety of forms.

Collaboration   

- 2-4: Exhibit dispositions necessary for collaboration: providing useful feedback, integrating feedback, understanding and accepting multiple perspectives, socialization. 


*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision. 
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.

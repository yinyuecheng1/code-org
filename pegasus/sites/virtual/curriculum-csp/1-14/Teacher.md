## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
How do we move data from one place to another? How do we encode it? How do we manage large amounts of data? Students will be able to answer these questions as they learn about Internet routing in Lesson 14. Activities include a video and an unplugged activity to "experience" moving data through a network.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 10 minutes
1) Review students' Internet of Things device concepts.

### **Activity: Internet Routing** - 30  minutes  
2) Video: Internet Routing.
3) Kinesthetic Unplugged Internet routing.

### **Wrap-up** - 10  minutes 
4) Reflect on student learning.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...   

- Describe the path that data follows as it travels the Internet.
- List elements of the Internet responsible for moving data and their functions.
- Define and describe the functions of a router.

 
# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Small pieces of paper that will act as "packets."

### For the Teacher
- Access to the video "There and Back Again: A Packet's Tale" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwyJGzZmBe8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwyJGzZmBe8)

## **Getting Started** (10 min) 
### 1) Manage devices on the Internet of Things.
- In a discussion, pose these questions:
 -  Consider the Internet sensing devices conceptualized in Lesson 13.
 -  Where did you anticipate that your data would go? How did you anticipate it would get there?   
 -  How do you think this happens with real devices on the Internet? 

## **Activity: Presentation on Routing** (30 min)  
### 2) Video: Internet Routing.
- View "There and Back Again: A Packet's Tale."
- Answer students' questions or ask a few to check for understanding.

### 3) Kinesthetic Unplugged Internet Routing.
- Set up the Activity. Pose the challenge to students that they will be sending packets of information (in a process similar to what they saw in the video) to each other without leaving their seats.
- Encourage students to think of some information they want to send in a message to a classmate, such as words, a picture, or a song.
- Ask the students to identify all of the information they think they will need to include in packets.
- Instruct students to make up several packets from the data in their message by writing pieces of it on the small pieces of paper.
- After students have made up several packets, tell them to start the transmission process. Encourage students to pass the packets, one student at a time, to the recipient without leaving their seats.
- As the students are transmitting packets, mix things up a bit, by simulating "lost" packets, or "unreadable" data.

## Teaching Tip
To make everyone feel a part of the activity, think about how you will ensure that each student not only sends a message, but also receives a message.
[/tip]


## **Wrap-up** (10 min)
### 4) Reflect on student learning.
- Engage students to summarize the activity.
- What worked, and what did not?
- Define terms such as packet and router.
- Make comparisons between what happened in the activity and what actually happens as data moves on the Internet. 

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Routers
- Research how routers use IP addresses to know where to send packets of information. Write one paragraph, write a poem or rap, or create a diagram to communicate what you learned on the topic.

### Traceroute
- Use a Traceroute utility to trace the path that a packet takes to get to your computer. Create a flowchart/path diagram to record what you learned.


## Assessment Questions
- Define router and packet.
- How does a router know where to send packets?
- How do the packets gets assembled at the destination so that the message is complete and correct?
- What problems can occur when packets are sent through the Internet?
- Draw and label a diagram that explains how routers send packets through the Internet.

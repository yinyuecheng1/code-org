title: Social Network Cliques and Connectors
description: "In this lesson students explore another NP hard problem known as the 'Vertex Cover' problem. The problem exists in the context of social network 'cliques' and involves finding the people in a social network who are the true 'connectors'. It is sometimes called the the ice cream truck problem.
What's fascinating about the clique problem is that is very hard (as students will discover) to discover the cliques in a network. But it is trivially easy to construct such a network. This makes it very different from the map coloring problem. It is potentially useful because a map that can be constructed with a known solution very easily but is NP hard to solve, lays the foundation for the idea of a 'one-way' function that can be used in encryption and security in the lessons that follow.

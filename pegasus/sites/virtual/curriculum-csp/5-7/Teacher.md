## Lesson Overview (New learning)
Through out this unit, students have explored a variety of innovations and examined the beneficial, harmful, short-term, long-term, initial, and secondary effects of each. Perhaps no innovation will have as much impact on the next decade as the innovations brought about by Big Data. In particular, societal norms about privacy will be challenged by the ability to access and aggregate information that we used to consider private.  

This lesson describes activities for three class periods. Teachers may choose to use  any or all of them or to add additional activities to best meet their students' needs and interests. Because it is important and newsworthy, we recommend spending at least two class periods on the topic of privacy.

## Day 1 - Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Journal: What kinds of personal information do you think businesses and the government should NOT be able to know?  
- Instruct students to list the kinds of personal information that should remain private in record their journal.

## Activity: Privacy and the Web (45 min)
### 2) Cookies and browser history
- Ask for volunteers to explain how Internet browser cookies work.
- Add to student responses to fully explain the concept.
- Guide students in learning how to disable cookies on a browser. Students can start by performing a search of "How do I turn off cookies in ....." with the name of the browser on their computer.

### 3) Scanning Posts and Emails
- As a class, briefly read and discuss a privacy policy from a major online service such Google or Facebook.
- Instruct students to work in pairs to research the privacy policy from another communication service they use.
-  Assign them to create a chart that shows similarities and differences between the two services.
- Allow time for discussion. Prompt students with questions such as:
 - "What rights are mentioned that surprised you?"
 - "Are there limits on your privacy that bother you?"
 - "What did you learn that you think most of your peers are not aware of?"

# Teaching Tip  
As you discuss each of the privacy topics in this lesson, you may want to remind your students of the thinking strategies used previously in this unit to explore the impact of innovations. For each innovation related to privacy discussed, find ways to ask students about the impact in terms of beneficial, harmful, short-term, long-term, initial, and secondary effects. 

[/tip]

## Day 2 - Activity: Privacy in Public (45 min)
### 4) Face Recognition and Public Street Cameras
- Set the stage for the video by asking students when they think they might have been unknowingly photographed in public spaces.
- Show [A Face in the Crowd: Say Goodbye to Anonymity](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-face-in-the-crowd-say-goodbye-to-anonymity-25-08-2013/)
- Discuss beneficial, harmful, short-term, long-term, initial, and secondary effects of this innovation. 

### 5) License Plate Recognition and Location Data
- Set the stage for the video by asking students if they are aware of any places in your community where license plates are scanned.
- Show [Police call license plate scanners critical, but do they violate your privacy?](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/police-call-license-plate-scanners-critical-but-do-they-violate-your-privacy/)
- Discuss beneficial, harmful, short-term, long-term, initial, and secondary effects. 

## Day 3 - Activity: Privacy and Surveillance (45 min)
### 6) The NSA's surveillance programs
- Select a resource about the NSA surveillance program to use in this activity. There are many possibilities - one is suggested below.
- Set the stage for the selected video or other resource by asking students what they have heard about the topic.
- Use their responses to set objectives for what they should watch for or learn more about in the video.
- A video to consider using for this activity is from [PBS Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/united-states-of-secrets/)
- This video is over 50 minutes, so you might want to show only some portions, watch it over two class periods, or assign some portion of it as homework.

# Teaching Tip  

Videos can add interest and interject another dimension to the classroom learning environment. Best practices include setting the stage for what students will learn about, providing a purpose or target for their attention, and follow-up with meaningful reflection. The videos suggested in these lessons can be spaced out or interspersed throughout this unit.   

[/tip]

## Wrap-up (5 min)

### 7) Wrap-up: Personal reflection
- This activity can be a short response used at the end of each class period of this lesson or an extended project at the end.
- Pose these questions: 
 - How has what you have learned in these lessons impacted your ideas about personal privacy?
 - What types of personal information should be in an "OK to collect" category and what types of information should be in a "never collect" category?  
 - Are there situations that can alter the enforcement of these categories?
- This activity could be modified, extended, or assigned as homework. Students could communicate their ideas and learning through:
 -  A journal entry
 -  Debate
 -  Trial or mock court session
 -  Poster
 -  Skit
 -  Song
 -  Reflective theme

## Extended Learning 

Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.


### Rewriting a "Privacy Statement" 
Select a privacy statement for an online service. Copy it to an editable format such as Google docs or Word. Cross out the elements you believe violate your privacy. Rewrite or add portions to the statement to reflect what you believe it should say to protect important aspects of personal privacy. 

### Rules for Protecting Personal Privacy 
Create a poster of rules students should follow to protect their personal privacy online. Display the poster in computer labs throughout the school.


## Assessment Questions
- Give an example of how personal information is collected through browsers. 
- Give an example of how personal information is collected through face recognition and license plate recognition.
- Give an example of how the NSA collected personal information from unsuspecting Internet users.

title: Privacy in the Age of Big Data
description: "Through out this unit, students have explored a variety of innovations and examined the beneficial, harmful, short-term, long-term, initial, and secondary effects of each. Perhaps no innovation will have as much impact on the next decade as the innovations brought about by Big Data. In particular, societal norms about privacy will be challenged by the ability to access and aggregate information that we used to consider private.  

This lesson describes activities for three class periods. Teachers may choose to use  any or all of them or to add additional activities to best meet their students' needs and interests. Because it is important and newsworthy, we recommend spending at least two class periods on the topic of privacy.

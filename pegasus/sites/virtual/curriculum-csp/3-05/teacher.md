## Lesson Overview (New Learning)

Now that the students are comfortable with creating simple programs, they are ready to add some new elements to their projects. Number calculations is one of the most basic - and powerful - computer functions. As students develop skills in programming calculations, we want them to see the connections with the number operations they are familiar with in the math classroom, and to understand that writing code to perform calculations is the backbone of solving problems with computing devices. In this lesson, students will learn to code the basic  operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division,  in JavaScript. Concepts related to the order of operations and strategies to test code for correctness are emphasized in Lesson 5 learning activities.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Students
- *Student Activity Guide: Calculations in JavaScript* 

### For the Teacher
- *Presentation: Calculations in JavaScript*    
- Familiarity with the rules for the Target Game and sample numbers to use


## Getting Started (15 min)
### 1) Journal entry and homework review 

- Instruct students to respond to the following questions in their journals using complete sentences: “What is the programmer’s responsibility in testing and debugging code? Does it change depending on the product’s end – use? For example, is testing and debugging more critical in a game or in a medical device such as a pacemaker? Do you think programmers should be held individually responsible for mistakes in the code they produced?”  
- Conduct a class discussion about the Round-off Error reading assigned in Lesson 4. Review the examples in the reading and ask students to identify the cause of each problem. 
- Be sure to discuss the programmer’s responsibility for the problems caused.

## Activity: Number Calculations (25 min)

### 2) Guided practice: Calculations in JavaScript
- Guide students through the activities in the *Presentation: Calculations in JavaScript*  
- Stop periodically to check for student understanding and to answer questions.

# Teaching Tip

Students are probably very comfortable working with graphing calculators in math classes. As they work through the guided practice in this lesson, point out that the way we write  calculations in a program looks very similar to what they do on a graphing calculator.

### 3) Independent Practice
- Independent Practice – Calculations in JavaScript.   
- Instruct the students to complete the *Student Activity Guide: Calculations in JavaScript*.

## Wrap-up – 10 minutes

### 4) The Target Game
- Write 5 random numbers on the board and a target number. 
- Provide the rules listed below.
- Play a few rounds of the game with the class. 

The Target Game Rules:  
- Using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with parenthesis () as needed, hit the target number. You must use each number once and only once.
- Example: the numbers 5 , 6 , 2 , 8 , 1 could hit the target number 17 by using this calculation: (6 – 5)(2 * 8) + 1  

- Assign an out-of-class activity: Write the algorithm for a program like the Target Game? What input would you need from the user? How would you get the five random numbers and the target?

# Teaching Tip

As students work through the activities in these lessons, the emphasis should be on coding accurately. As they develop more programming skills the complexity of the programs they write will increase. Learning to test for accuracy as you go is vital to developing correct solutions.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

title: Passwords and Public Keys
description: "In this lesson, students are reminded of the idea of a one-way function from the Social Network Coverage problem and are introduced to the concept of a hash function as a one-way function that can be used to encrypt a password for secure transfer over the Internet. Students invent their own hash function and use it to keep a database of their friends' passwords. The security of such a password file is considered. It helps explain why a system administrator can never tell you your password, but why you can change it as long as you know the old one.

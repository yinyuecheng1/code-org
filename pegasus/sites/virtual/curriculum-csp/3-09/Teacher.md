## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In this lesson, students will move past simply using a computer like a calculator and towards using programs to implement more complex algorithms. The first building block is the if-statement. which allows programs to make simple decisions. 


[summary]

## Teaching Summary

### **Getting Started** – 10 minutes

1) Code check-up

### **Activity: Making Decisions with Simple If-Statements** – 30 minutes

2) Guided practice: Presentation  
3) Independent Practice

### **Wrap-up** – 10 minutes

4) Check for Understanding  
5) Journal Entry: Making Decisions

## Lesson Objectives

The students will...

- Use relational operators in if-statements to make decisions in the context of a JavaScript program.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources, and Prep

### For the Student

- JavaScript program file: *decision.js*   
- *Student Activity Guide: Decisions with If-statements*

### For the Teacher

- *Presentation: Simple If-statements*


## Getting Started (10 min)

### 1) Code check-up

Guide the students to download and run the program *decisions.js*. It is intended to output the larger of the two numbers entered. Instruct the students to fix the code so it works as intended.

## Activity: Making Decisions with Simple If-statements (30 min)

### 2) Guided practice: Simple If-statements  
 - Direct student learning with the content in the *Presentation: Simple If-Statements*

### 3) Independent Practice: Simple If-statements

- Instruct students to complete the activities on the *Student Activity Guide: Making Decisions with If-statements*

### Wrap-up (10 min)

4) Check for Understanding

Instruct students to record if the following statements are true or false. Provide answers and answer student questions.

var n = “Fido”  

if (n =- “Fido”)  
if (n =- “fido”)  
if (n == Fido)   

### 5) Journal Entry

Assign students to respond in their journal to the prompt: If-statements are used to make decisions in programming. 
- Recall some of the programs you have written up to this point in the course. 
- Identify 2 that would have been improved if you had used an if-statement. 
- How would an if-statement have improved the program?

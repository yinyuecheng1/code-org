title: Impact on Other Fields
description: "Computing innovations have impacted our daily lives and our society in a multitude of ways. But these innovations have also sparked additional innovations in other fields beyond computer science. Fields as varied as science research, social science, the arts, government, entertainment, sports, health, education, and politics have all been impacted by computational techniques and technologies. Studying the impact on other fields allows students not only to see more evidence of the secondary effects of computing innovations, but also to consider how computational thinking and technology will impact the career fields they may enter as adults.  

To prepare for the performance task at the end of this unit, students will practice independent research skills and learn to generate citations using a website service.

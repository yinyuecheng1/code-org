## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Computing innovations have impacted our daily lives and our society in a multitude of ways. But these innovations have also sparked additional innovations in other fields beyond computer science. Fields as varied as science research, social science, the arts, government, entertainment, sports, health, education, and politics have all been impacted by computational techniques and technologies. Studying the impact on other fields allows students not only to see more evidence of the secondary effects of computing innovations, but also to consider how computational thinking and technology will impact the career fields they may enter as adults.  

To prepare for the performance task at the end of this unit, students will practice independent research skills and learn to generate citations using a website service.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...   

- Give examples of how computational thinking intersects with other academic and career fields.
- Use a search engine to gather information on the impact of computation on other fields.
- Create citations using a website service.
 
 
# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Access to the Internet for research
- Access to [EasyBib](http://www.easybib.com/) or [BibMe](http://www.bibme.org/)


### For the Teacher
- Background viewing [UW-Madison Humanities Hackathon](http://vimeo.com/47591619)
- Background reading [RPI: What is Bioinformatics?](http://www.rpi.edu/academics/interdisciplinary/what_is_bioinformatics.html)


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Journal entry: How has computational thinking impacted the field of your favorite school subject or activity?
- Instruct students to respond in their journals: "What is your favorite school subject or activity? How do you think computational thinking or computation impacts the careers in that field?"


## Activity: Activity: Learning More about the Impact of Computation (30 min)
### 2) Teacher presentation.
- Prepare a short presentation about how computational thinking has combined with another field. 
- Use the background reading, other websites, or your own experience as resources for this short presentation to students.
- Consider talking about area of your own interests, ask other teachers in your school for information about computing their fields, or invite them to be guest lecturers.


### 3) Explore of other fields.
- Instruct students to think about their favorite school subject or activity - perhaps one they think they might like to pursue as a career. 
- Assign them to search for articles or websites that explain how computational thinking is used in that field or career.
- Encourage students to develop some independent research skills by providing minimal guidance for this mini-research project. This is an important skill for successfully completing the individual portion of the performance task. 
- Remind students to use only reliable and reputable web sources.
- Encourage students to find 3 or more sites or articles.
- If students find a few sites quickly, they should refine their focus to sites that explain how computation is used and how it has impacted the field.

### 4) Create citations with website services.
- Guide students to practice using a website to generate citations for the articles they used for their mini-research activity.
- Direct students to [EasyBib](http://www.easybib.com/) or [BibMe](http://www.bibme.org/) to create citations for the resources they locate.
- Direct them to past the citations into a document as practice for the performance task. And if desired, ask students to submit the final document of citations to you.

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 5) Share student learning.
- Depending on how much time remains, do a quick whip-around to allow students to share their topic and one example of how computational thinking is used in the field.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Beneficial and Harmful Effects
Think about the beneficial and harmful effects that computation could have on the field you researched. Create a two-column table, an image collage, or a drawing to communicate your thoughts.


## Assessment Questions
- Give examples of how computational thinking impacts with other academic fields.
- Name a website you can use to generate citations.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In Unit 3, students learned the fundamentals of programming in JavaScript.  In this lesson, they will apply programming to data. While there are many ways to look at data, the fundamental container for data in JavaScript is an array. Once the data is in arrays, students can process through the data with a 'for' loop. Processing data programatically enhances students' understanding of data storage and manipulation in with other tools.

This lesson uses the CodeCademy.com website. During the first day of the lesson, students review the 'for loop' that they learned in Unit 3 and then use 'for loops' to understand arrays. In the second day of the lesson, students do more with arrays with JavaScript.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Journal
- Access to Codecademy.com.  A login is not necessary but is helpful for the student to save their work. 

### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet
- Background Reading: W3 Schools Tutorial [http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp](http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp).  This tutorial is not the best way for students to learn about arrays, but it can be useful for the teacher. 


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Partner Activity: Review of JavaScript.
- If possible, ask students to open up their final JavaScript project from Unit 3.
- Guide students to switch computer screens with an elbow partner and examine their partner's project. If there are parts of the code that they do not understand, they should ask the partner to explain the program elements.
- Gather the class back together to review aspect of JavaScript that will be relevant to learning about arrays. Point out elements such as variables, assignment statements, strings, if statements, for loops, and math functions.
- After reviewing each element, ask students to raise their hands if they they see it on their partner's screens.  

## Day 1 - Activity: CodeCademy For Loops (40 min)
### 2) Learn more about 'for loops' and arrays.

- Direct students to CodeCademy.com.
- If you want students' work to be saved, ask them to create a login.
- Direct students to choose the JavaScript course.
- Within the JavaScript course, direct students to choose the "For Loops Lesson." 
- This lesson has 13 parts.....you should guide the class through parts 1 and 2, and perhaps others.  
- Encourage students to work at their own computer, but do the work simultaneously with a partner. Students can help each other fix their mistakes. 
- If students finish early, they may explore other sections of CodeCademy.

# Teaching Tip  
CodeCademy.org is not the website you want! Remind students of the proper URL - http://www.codecademy.com/. 
[/tip]


## Day 2 Activity: CodeCademy Arrays (40 min)  
### 3) Practice with arrays.  
- Remind students how to get to CodeCademy.com.
- Direct students to the JavaScript course lesson on arrays. The website may drop students into the place where they left off, so you will need to help them find this lesson.  
- This lesson has 17 parts, but only the first 7 are about arrays. You may want to lead the students through the first 1 or 2 exercises. 

[tip]
# Teaching Tip  
If desired, employ a quick Round Robin as a  Getting Started by asking students to recall something they learned about arrays from Day 1 of this lesson. 
[/tip]

 
## Wrap-up Reflection (10 min)
### 4) Journal Prompt: "Describe the relationship between arrays and data as they relate to programming." 

## Checking for Understanding
- Write JavaScript code that creates an array to hold the names of five people. 
- Write JavaScript code that would loop through an array of numbers and count how many of the numbers are larger than 100.  


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### JavaScript Array commands

- Research commands that can be performed on a JavaScript array. Select one that you do not understand clearly and learn more about it. Prepare to report on it, and perhaps demonstrate, to the class. 

### More CodeCademy
- Choose one or more of the CodeCademy JavaScript Lessons.  Complete the lesson and summarize what you learned.

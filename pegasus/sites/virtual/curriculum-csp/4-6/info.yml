title: Arrays in JavaScript
description: "In Unit 3, students learned the fundamentals of programming in JavaScript.  In this lesson, they will apply programming to data. While there are many ways to look at data, the fundamental container for data in JavaScript is an array. Once the data is in arrays, students can process through the data with a 'for' loop. Processing data programatically enhances students' understanding of data storage and manipulation in with other tools.

This lesson uses the CodeCademy.com website. During the first day of the lesson, students review the 'for loop' that they learned in Unit 3 and then use 'for loops' to understand arrays. In the second day of the lesson, students do more with arrays with JavaScript.

title: Limitations of Representing Numbers with Bits
description: "In this lesson, students will learn about the limitations of representing values with a fixed number of bits and the resulting errors. They will explore overflow errors using calculators and simulate using a very limited calculator. They will explore the JavaScript alert() statement on a website and use it to produce precision errors in representing decimals between 0 and 1. Students will experience additional precision errors using an online binary/decimal conversion too. Understanding WHY the errors occur is fundamental to their complete understanding of using bits to represent values.

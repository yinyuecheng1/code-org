title: Compare and Analyze Sorting Algorithms
description: "In this lesson, students review the sorting algorithms they wrote in  Lesson 2. Students will follow the algorithms created by their classmates and discover a variety of sorting strategies. By analyzing the various algorithms, students will attempt to find the 'best' sorting strategy. There are two main difficulties in algorithm design to highlight: 1) It is very difficult to be precise with language without some agreement about what terms mean. This will eventually motivate the need for a programming language. 2) Solving the problem by determining the strategies and steps required to sort objects correctly, as well as efficiently, presents a second level of difficulty.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)

In this lesson, students review the sorting algorithms they wrote in  Lesson 2. Students will follow the algorithms created by their classmates and discover a variety of sorting strategies. By analyzing the various algorithms, students will attempt to find the "best" sorting strategy.

There are two main difficulties in algorithm design to highlight: 1) It is very difficult to be precise with language without some agreement about what terms mean. This will eventually motivate the need for a programming language. 2) Solving the problem by determining the strategies and steps required to sort objects correctly, as well as efficiently, presents a second level of difficulty.

### **Activity: Algorithm exchange** - 20  minutes  
3) Provide feedback.  
4) Identify the "best" algorithm and justify.

### **Class discussion: What is the best way to sort?** - 15  minutes 
5) How should we measure algorithms?

## **Wrap-Up** - 5  minutes 
6) Summarize issues related to writing algorithms.
7) Assign homework.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Analyze the differences and similarities between algorithms designed to do the same thing but written differently.
- Describe how algorithms should be analyzed.


# Teaching Guide 
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- Playing cards
- *Student Activity Guide: Sorting Algorithm Examination*

### For the Teacher


## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Think-Pair-Share.
- What was the hardest part in writing a card sorting algorithm?  What would have made it easier?  

### 2) Journal entry.

- Instruct students to answer this question in their journal: How do you think a sorting algorithm should be "measured" to determine if it is the "best"? 

## Activity: Algorithm Exchange (20 min)
### 3) Provide feedback.
- Distribute the *Student Activity Guide: Sorting Algorithm Examination.*
- Re-distribute playing cards to student pairs.
- Each pair should swap their written algorithm with another pair and attempt to follow the shared algorithm exactly and literally.  
- Instruct students to use the Activity Guide to record their experiences.

### 4) Identify the "best" algorithm and justify.
- Create groups of four by joining the pairs who previously exchanged algorithms.

# Teaching Tip
This "swapping algorithm" activity works really well when students exchange algorithms with a group with a fundamentally different approach. However, as a practical matter this can be hard to arrange.  From your observations during Lesson 2, you might have a sense of groups with different approaches that you can assign to swap algorithms.

[/tip]


- Groups should give feedback to each other about the algorithm, making sure to discuss:
	- The algorithm's correctness - does it work, do you understand it, could you act it out?
	- Explain confusing/ambiguous parts of the other group's algorithm in order to help them write it better.
	- Discuss which of the two algorithms is "better" and be able to explain why.
	- Each group of 4 will nominate one of the two algorithms as the better one of the group.


## Class discussion: What is the best way to sort? (15  min)
### 5) How should we measure algorithms?

- Ask a groups to volunteer the better algorithm at their table. 
- Act out one group's instructions.


[tip]

# Teaching Tip
It is possible that the nominated algorithm won't work perfectly. If you encounter any problems with the directions, give them the benefit of the doubt and act it out as best you can to enable the class to understand the intent.

[/tip]

- Ask if other groups solved the problem with a different strategy and demonstrate a few groups' algorithms.
- Engage students in a discussion about which algorithm was the best. Why is it best? How should algorithms be evaluated?
- Ask students to argue for one method or another and explain their reasons.
 - NOTE: They will perform an actual analysis in a later lesson, so it's okay at this point to simply guide the discussion to see how students are thinking. They will re-examine these ideas later.

[tip]

# Teaching Tip
The speed at which the actor can follow the algorithm is not a measure of the algorithm, but rather the speed of the person. As an analogy you might compare a person's walking speed with the distance they have to travel. To compare algorithms you need to measure some "units of work". What those units are is debatable, but must to be agreed upon. For card sorting, "work" could mean picking a card up, putting it down, comparing with another card, etc.

## Wrap-Up (5 min)
### 6) Summarize algorithms-writing issues.
- Remind students of the two main issues related to writing algorithms:
 -  The need for a clear, unambiguous language for expressing 'programmatic' solutions.
 -  Criteria for determining if an algorithm is "good"

### 7) Assign homework.
- Assign students to write a final version of their algorithm, working out any ambiguities or other problems revealed during the activities.

## Extended Learning 

### Creating other algorithms
Instead of writing an algorithm in English, engage students to write the Median of Three algorithm is another language such as Spanish, French, or other language they know and test it with another language speaker. This activity could also be accomplished with sign language or with a sketch and similarly tested. A compare and contrast chart can be used to describe similarities or differences in the experience compared to writing the algorithm in English.

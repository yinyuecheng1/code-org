title: The Impact of Innovation
description: "This optional lesson can be used as a brief preview to the course on the first day of class
 when teachers typically have many classroom administrative tasks to accomplish, 
 but also want to set the stage for the class. Students begin thinking about the 
 influences of technology as they engage in a Think-Pair-Share strategy about the computing 
 innovations that have impacted their lives. In addition, this is an opportunity to set beginning 
 expectations about interacting with classmates in collaborative activities and to model writing in the content area. Please provide <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eL7g_o3lfgtdT1jiMZqUNh5_NCGBHqNGEj0t5K4d9hA/viewform?usp=send_form'> feedback on this lesson.</a>"

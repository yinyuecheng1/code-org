## Lesson Overview (Discovery)
In Lesson 1, students work in pairs to design a physical device to send a single bit of information across the room. This collaborative project has several goals:  

- Work with others to solve a complex problem.
- Understand how bits can be used to communicate information.
- Employ a design-create-evaluate-redesign paradigm.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 10 minutes
1) Discussion:  What is a bit? What kinds of information could we send with a single bit? 

### **Journal Setup and Prompt** - 10 minutes
2) Using a journal for learning.  

### **Activity: Sending Bits Challenge** - 20  minutes  
3) Design a bit-sending device.

### **Wrap-up** - 10  minutes 
4) Discuss the Think-Make-Improve strategy.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Establish a journal for recording their questions, reactions, ideas, and learning progression.
- Apply the concept of "bit" to personally meaningful information.
- Collaborate to solve a complex problem.
- Design a device to send a bit across the classroom using everyday objects.
- Experiment with various implementations of their device design.

# Teaching Guide

## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Journal
- A collection of "bit-sending supplies"

### For the Teacher
- A large communal collection of "bit sending supplies" such as small flashlights, noise makers, bells, whistles, cups and string, tape, wire, Slinky, LEGOS(R), colored paper, and other common items.
- A place to store these supplies that is accessible to students.
- Optional: A separate box of supplies for each student team. 

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Class discussion
- Display or project this question: What is a "bit"?
- Quickly survey the students to discover their prior knowledge. Do not allow a few students to dominate the discussion; work to engage as many students as possible in sharing ideas.

# Teaching Tip

Students will come into the course with a variety of prior knowledge. Work to include everyone in the discussions so that students who think they know "the" answer do not dominate the activity.

## Activity: Journal Setup and Prompt (10 min)

### 2) Using a journal for learning.

- In this course, students will keep a journal and make entries in it on a regular basis. Journals help students to organize their thoughts and track their understanding and learning. Set expectations for student journals and consider how you will use journals for informal assessment. Remind them that engineers and inventors record their ideas in journals, also. 
- Communicate your expectations for their journals: 
  - Where will they keep their journals? 
  - What format do you expect for each entry? 
  - What level of formal writing do you expect? 
  - When will you read their journals? 
  - Will you use the journals in assessment?  
- After students understand your expectations, provide this first journal prompt: "What message can you send with a single bit that your classmates would find useful?"


## Activity: Sending Bits Challenge (20  min)  

### 3) Design a bit-sending device.
- Pose the problem of making a device that sends a bit to a partner across the room. 
- Using the bit-sending supplies, students must design a system to send a single bit of information across the room. In their design they may include any personal supplies that they have on-hand and/or select from the supplies provided.
- The student teams will design (sketch) plans for the device in this lesson period and create it in the next class meeting.  
- This is a partner activity. Because this is the first collaborative activity of the year, take time to discuss your expectations for team projects. 
- During the activity, it is important for students to communicate with their partners. Allow ample time for them to talk through and explore their ideas. Time is allocated in the next class meeting for actually building the device and completing the challenge. 

## Wrap-up (10  min) 

### 4) Discuss the Think-Make-Improve strategy.
- Ask students to record any ideas they have for design improvements in their journal. They will use this list to consider any design changes when they implement their plans in the next class meeting.  

## Extended Learning 

Use this activity to enhance student learning. It can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### History of Sending Bits

- Research some of the earliest methods used to send information between humans. Determine if the information sent meets the definition of "bit" as discussed in today's lesson. Create (or locate) some of these early devices and demonstrate how they work to the class.


## Assessment Questions
- How would you explain the word "bit" to a friend who is not in this class?
- List devices in our school that send a single bit of information.  
- If you could put a signal on your locker or bedroom door that communicated one bit of information, what would the signal be? What would it communicate? 
- Think about this first collaboration experience in this class. List three guidelines for effectively working on a team to solve problems such as the bit-sending challenge. Evaluate your efforts in following the guidelines.

## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principle Learning Objectives

2.1.1 Describe the combination of abstractions used to represent data.  
2.1.2 Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.  
2.2.2 Use multiple levels of abstraction in computation.  

### Other standards 

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

 - Collaboration 2-4: Exhibit dispositions necessary for collaboration: providing useful feedback, integrating feedback, understanding and accepting multiple perspectives, socialization. 
 - Computational Thinking 3B-7: Discuss the interpretation of binary sequences in a variety of forms (e.g., instructions, numbers, text, sound, image).
 
*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*

 - 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
 - 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
 - 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
 - 6. Attend to precision.

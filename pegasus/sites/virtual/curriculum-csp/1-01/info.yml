title: Sending a Bit
description: "In Lesson 1, students work in pairs to design a physical device to send a single bit of information across the room. This collaborative project has several goals:
work with others to solve a complex problem; understand how bits can be used to communicate information; and employ a design-create-evaluate-redesign paradigm.

## Lesson Overview

This lesson introduces students to the use of JavaScript methods by exploring Timing Events. After a brief review of global variables and counters and guided practice using a timer, they will apply these concept in programming a simple animation. This lesson is a useful introduction to creating computer games that can be further explored in extended learning opportunities.

- Analyze web applications to identify possible uses of timers.


# Teaching Guide  

## Materials, Resources and Prep

### For the Students
- Journal

### For the Teacher
- *Teacher Presentation: Using a Timer*


## Getting Started (10 min)

### 1) Code checkup - Global variables and counting

- Guide students to write a program with two buttons and a field that displays a count. When the button on the left is clicked, the count should go down by one. When the button on the right is clicked, the count should go up by one.
- Check to be sure that they are all able to declare a global variables and use it as a counter.


## Activity: Learning to Use a Timer (30 min)

### 2) Guided practice - Lab lecture: Using a Timer

- Direct student learning with the content in the *Teacher Presentation: Using a Timer*.
- Monitor students as they work on the **Challenge Project** described on the last slide of the presentation.

## Wrap-up (5 min)

### 3) Gallery walk

- Instruct students to walk around the classroom and observe each others programs.

### 4) Journal entry: Automated tasks

- Assign as homework: Respond to the prompt: How do you think timers are used in the types of things websites are able to do? Cite 3 examples you have experienced on websites that you think were impacted by timers. Why do you think the developers chose to use a time in these situations?

# Teaching Tip 
When a new topic is introduced it can be helpful for students to practice the skills in a partner activity. It is important that the role of entering code be equally shared.

[/tip]

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.


### Creating Games 
Timers are important elements in computer games. Design a game using the techniques learned in this lesson. This is an ideal project to work on with a partner. Share the results with your classmates.

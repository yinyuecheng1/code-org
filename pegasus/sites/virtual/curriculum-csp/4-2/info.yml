title: Metadata
description: "In Lesson 1, students developed vocabulary to describe the difference between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. In this lesson, students will use this new vocabulary as they examine images to understand how metadata is collected and how it can provide insights.

Our definition of metadata is 'information that is added to a file.' Students will see and use metadata in the form of location information that has been added to pictures.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In Lesson 1, students developed vocabulary to describe the difference between data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. In this lesson, students will use this new vocabulary as they examine images to understand how metadata is collected and how it can provide insights.

Our definition of metadata is "information that is added to a file." Students will see and use metadata in the form of location information that has been added to pictures.

## Lesson Objectives 
The students will...

- Define metadata
- Give examples of devices that collect metadata or files that hold metadata
- Explain the privacy issues that result from the collection of metadata

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Journal
- Access to Flickr [https://www.flickr.com/](https://www.flickr.com/)
- Access to YouTube Metadata tutorial [https://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/metadata.html](https://www.youtube.com/yt/playbook/metadata.html)


### For the Teacher
- Access to the Internet
- Background Reading:  Metadata [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata)
- Background Reading:  EXIF file [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format)


## Getting Started (5 min)
### 1) Journal Prompt: "What information is stored in a digital picture?"
- Instruct students to respond to the prompt in their journals.
  
## Activity: Discovering Metadata in Photos (15 min)
### 2) Search on Flickr for Photo Metadata.
- Students do not need to sign into Flickr [https://www.flickr.com/](https://www.flickr.com/) to access the files.
- Ask students to search on Flickr for a known place near your school and choose one of the pictures found.
- Ask students see if the picture is associated with a location on the map.
- Ask students to open up the EXIF file to read all the extra metadata associated with the picture.
- Introduce the term metadata to the class and relate the term to the information students are seeing with the photos.  
- You may need to explain some of the metadata they find.

## Activity: Exploring Meta Data (20 min)
### 3) Extended Learning Activities
- Choose one of the Extended Learning Activities below that will work in your classroom environment.

# Teaching Tip  
This lesson has time built in for the extended learning activities. School networks may have limited access to sites such as YouTube or a music player.  Select the activities that your school network will allow and topics that interest your students. If you as the teacher have greater network access, you might choose to complete an activity as a group or assign as homework.
[/tip]

## Wrap-up Reflection (10 min)
### 4) Class Discussion
- Redirect students back to their journals. Ask them to revise what they wrote at the beginning of the class to reflect their new knowledge about metadata in images.
- Ask students, "Now that you have learned about metadata, what kind of privacy concerns do you see with the metadata that is associated with public photos or videos?"


## Checking for Understanding
- What is metadata? 
- Give two examples of devices that collect metadata.
- Give an example of how privacy can be compromised with metadata.


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Accessing MetaData in your computer's media player
- Music players have access to metadata for each song. Look at the music player on your computer, and make a list of  the different kinds of metadata is shows. 

### Devices that Collect Metadata
- There are many other devices that collect metadata. Research one of these devices and prepare to tell the class your results. 

### Research the term Metadata
- Our working definition of metadata is "information that is added to a file."  What are some other definitions of metadata? What are some examples of the different kinds of metadata? 

### Learn how lattitude and longitude work
- Today's lesson took location data and automatically mapped it. Location data is reported in the form of longitude and latitude. To learn more about Longitude and Latitude, you could watch this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swKBi6hHHMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swKBi6hHHMA).  

### Add Metadata to a video
- You can add metadata to a video that you create. Sites such as YouTube and ScreenCastOMatic allow you to do this.  
- Use one of these tools and add metadata to a video you created.


## Connections and Background Information
### CS Principles Learning Objectives


3.2.1 Extract information from data to discover and explain connections, patterns, or trends. [P1]


### Other Standards

*CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards*

CT.L2-15 Provide examples of interdisciplinary applications of computational thinking. 
CT.L3B-05 Use data analysis to enhance understanding of complex natural and human systems. 
CPP.L3A-06 Select appropriate file formats for various types and uses of data. 

*Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice*
2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively. 
7. Look for and make use of structure.

## Lesson Overview 
In this lesson, students will explore the JavaScript Math Class online and learn to use the library functions to perform math calculations in lesson activities. The JavaScript Libraries include a vast array of Classes that can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.

## Lesson Objectives

The students will...

- Perform calculations using the JavaScript Math Class in the context of a JavaScript program (pow, random, round, and sqrt).  
- Define the term API.  
- Solve mathematical problems using the JavaScript Math API in the context of a JavaScript program.
- Become comfortable searching online for programming resources. 


## Materials, Resources and Prep

### For the Student
- Student Activity Guide: Practice with the JavaScript Math Class
- Link to the JavaScript Math Class [http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp]() 


### For the Teacher

- TBD

# Teaching Guide

## Getting Started (20 min)  
### 1) Practice Random Numbers

- Guide students to write JavaScript code to generate random numbers between:

 -  1 and 50
 -  20 and 50
 - -30 and 30  

- Instruct them to trade computers with their elbow partners and verify that the code works.
- Discuss with the entire class about how you would prove that the code works. Is testing it 10 times enough? 100?

- Review the out-of-class assignment from Lesson 6 – ask for their ideas on how they could test such a program. 
- Show them with a program that JavaScript does allow modular division on decimals. WILL THIS BE PROVIDED IN THE RESOURCES FOLDER??

## Activity: Working with the JavaScript Math Class (25 min)

### 2) Guided Practice  
- Instruct students to work with a partner to complete the *Student Activity Guide: JavaScript Math Class*

### 3) Independent Practice
Instruct student to independently complete the Independent Practice problems on the Student Activity Guide. 
IS THIS ON THE SAME DOCUMENT? 

## Wrap-up – 5 minutes

### 4) Discussion Board – Random Numbers

 instruct students to explore the [random.org]() website and discuss these questions Using an online discussion board or in small group discussions.

- What does the site mean by "true randomness?"  
- How do we know their random numbers are better than pseudo-random numbers?
- What problems can pseudo-random numbers inject into programs?

### 5) Just how big IS JavaScript?
Assign an out-of-class activity:
- Visit W3 website [http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/]().
- Select two of the other libraries listed and answer the following questions:

1. What problem does it solve?
2. Does it store any data?
3. List two methods in the library.

# Teaching Tip
Competent student computer scientists must become comfortable with finding the answers to some of their own questions and problems. Encourage them to explore the JavaScript Libraries to discover resources that them might want to use in future projects.

## Extended Learning
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Analytical Engine

Ted Talk: Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace [http://www.ted.com/talks/john_graham_cumming_the_greatest_machine_that_never_was]() 

This video provides an interesting introduction to the earliest plans for computers and description of Ada Lovelace’s role in the development of computer science as a field of study. Assign students to speculate on what might have happened if Babbage and Lovelace had not worked together.

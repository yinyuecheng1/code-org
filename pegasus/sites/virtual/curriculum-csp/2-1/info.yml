title: What is an Algorithm?
description: "In this lesson, students construct their own knowledge of algorithms by writing one of their own. The topic for their algorithm is the 'Median of Three' problem. Students encounter the difficulty of having to specify exact actions with inexact or ambiguous language. This lesson also lays the foundation for motivating the need for a programming language.  Students develop algorithms to solve a task in pairs and then analyze each others' work. Students create a working definition of 'algorithm.'

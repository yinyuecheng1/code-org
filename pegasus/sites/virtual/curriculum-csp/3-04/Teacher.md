[/summary]

## Lesson Objectives

The students will...  

- Describe the operations of a computer using von Neumann architecture.
- Describe the operations of a computer using dual core architecture.
- Draw the basic components of a CPU.
- Accurately describe round-off errors.
- Identify potential problems that can result from round-off errors.

# Teaching Guide

## Materials, Resources and Prep

### For the Students
- Markers, index cards
- *Student Activity Guide: von Neumann versus Dual Core*
- *Student Activity Guide: Round-off Errors*
- Journal

### For the Teacher

- Handout with computer “commands”

## Getting Started (5 min)

### 1) Journal Entry: Define "algorithm."
- Pose the question: How would you define the term algorithm as it relates to computing?
- Instruct students to independently record their answers in their journal or other tool. (A website such as Lino.it can be used.)
- Students should be able to very quickly respond as this is a review of content from Unit 2.
- When students have individually responded, engage the entire class to share ideas. You may have to ask leading questions to ensure that they recall that algorithms must include all of these elements:

 - Steps in a specific order.
 - Clear instructions.
 - Operations that can be performed by a computer.
 - Produce some result.
 - Stop in a finite amount of time.

## Activity: Computer Architecture (25 min)

### 2) von Neumann versus Dual Core  

- Divide the class up into groups of 5 students each. Distribute a copy of the *Student Activity Guide: von Neumann and Dual Core*, and several index cards and markers to use while running the simulation.
- Guide the students though the activity. 
  - Step 1: Following the directions, they will mimic a single-core computer processor. At the end, discuss how the simulation represented the operations of a single-core processor and answer any questions that they have. 
  - Ask: "What happens as the processor runs faster and faster?" (answer: heat) 
  - Explain that heat can cause many problems in a computer, so computer engineers have solved the problem by building machines with multiple processors or cores. 

## Wrap-up (5 min)

### 3) Analyze computer science in advertising
Give the following out-of-class assignment:

- Look through magazines and newspapers to find advertisements for cell phones; look specifically for phones that advertise  multi-core processors. 
- Select one advertisements and reflect on it your journal.    
  - Do you think most people know what multi-core processing is? 
  - Why do marketers emphasize this in their ads?

### 4) Student Activity Guide: Roundoff Errors Reading
- Distribute the article. Assign students to read it before the next class meeting.


## Extended Learning

### John von Neumann

John von Neumann was a polymath that worked in many fields throughout the middle part of the twentieth century. Not only was he a pioneer in the field of computing, but he made major contributions in the areas of economic, mathematics, and physics. Research his life and make a poster about his contributions in these areas.

## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
In this lesson, students will continue exploring processes for converting between hexadecimal, decimal, and binary number representations. By the end of the activities, they will be able to describe the conversion algorithms. The concept of hexadecimal values will become more apparent when students learn about the limitations of IPv4 addresses and the solutions found in IPv6 addresses, which are written in hexadecimal.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- [*Student Activity Guide: Converting Hexadecimal*](resources/U1_L10_Student_Practice_Exercises.pdf)
- Journal
- Calculator program on their computers


### For the Teacher
- Projection system for demonstrations and video
- Access to [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uwjt32NvVA&list=UUK8sQmJBp8GCxrOtXWBpyEA&index=0&feature=plcp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uwjt32NvVA&list=UUK8sQmJBp8GCxrOtXWBpyEA&index=0&feature=plcp)
  
## **Getting Started** (10 min)
### 1) IPv6 addresses.
- Show the video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uwjt32NvVA&list=UUK8sQmJBp8GCxrOtXWBpyEA&index=0&feature=plcp](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uwjt32NvVA&list=UUK8sQmJBp8GCxrOtXWBpyEA&index=0&feature=plcp) on IPv6 addresses. 
- Instruct students to explain the value of IPv6 by creating an entry in their journals. If necessary, allow students to research on the web.  

## **Activity: Converting IPv6 Hexadecimal and Binary** (10  min)  
### 2) Convert between hexadecimal and binary.  
-  Demonstrate the conversion process. 
-  Provide practice for students with the Student Activity Guide.

# Teaching Tip: 

Some students may ask to use a calculator when converting. A best practice is to encourage students to perform the calculations without a calculator until they understand the process.

[/tip]

## **Activity: Converting Hexadecimal and Decimal** (10 min) 

### 3) Convert between hexadecimal and decimal. 
-  Demonstrate the conversion process. 
-  Provide practice for students with the Student Activity Guide. 
 


## **Wrap-up** (5 min) 
### 4) Think-Write-Pair-Share.
- Instruct students to summarize the algorithm for converting between number bases in their journals, share with an elbow partner, and correct any misunderstanding either may have.


## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside-of-class activities or other enrichment.

### Converting Between Two Bases
- Examine the calculator on your computer to discover its capacity to convert between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal.
- Research algorithms to convert a number from any number base into another base. 


## Formative Assessment Questions
- What is the connection between binary and hexadecimal?  
- Describe the algorithm for converting between hexadecimal and decimal.
- Describe the algorithm for converting between hexadecimal and binary.
- Which system do you like better, hexadecimal or binary? Explain why. 
- What problems are solved with IPv6?

title: Converting between Hexadecimal, Decimal, and Binary
description: "In this lesson, students will continue exploring processes for converting between hexadecimal, decimal, and binary number representations. By the end of the activities, they will be able to describe the conversion algorithms. The concept of hexadecimal values will become more apparent when students learn about the limitations of IPv4 addresses and the solutions found in IPv6 addresses, which are written in hexadecimal.

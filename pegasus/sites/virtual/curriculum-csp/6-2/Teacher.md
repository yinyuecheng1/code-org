## Lesson Overview (New Learning)
Models and simulations use abstraction togenerate new understanding and knowledge. After playing analyzing simulations students will create their own simulation. They will evaluate the simulation to see what aspects of the real-world phenomenon were removed, and what key aspects remain.  Students will work with a partner to give them practice for the Performance Task at the end of the next unit. This lesson will take two days to complete.

## Checking for Understanding
- Write JavaScript code that would generate a random integer between 10 and 99.
- Write JavaScript code that would simulate the rolling two dice, and print out their sum. 



## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Add visualizations

- Add visualizations to your simulation.  These visualizatinos could take the form of graphics or images.

title: Laboratory - For Loop
description: "This lesson is designed for two class meetings. Student learning will be assessed through a lab project in which they will demonstrate their understanding of the for-loop algorithm using JavaScript. The goal of the lab assignment is for students to be creative with picture manipulation using the skills and techniques learned in earlier lessons. Students can either take a photograph to use in the lab, use a photo they already have, or use the image provided in the lesson resources. Using skills practiced in previous lessons, they will use FOR loops to make color changes and other manipulations to the images. During the first class meeting of this two-day lesson, students will begin the lab programming assignment. The second class meeting will include a quiz on the for-loop syntax and provide time for them to complete the programming project.

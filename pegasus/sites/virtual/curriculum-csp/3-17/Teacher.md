## Lesson Overview (Assessment)

This lesson is designed for two class meetings. Student learning will be assessed through a lab project in which they will demonstrate their understanding of the for-loop algorithm using JavaScript. The goal of the lab assignment is for students to be creative with picture manipulation using the skills and techniques learned in earlier lessons. Students can either take a photograph to use in the lab, use a photo they already have, or use the image provided in the lesson resources. Using skills practiced in previous lessons, they will use FOR loops to make color changes and other manipulations to the images. During the first class meeting of this two-day lesson, students will begin the lab programming assignment. The second class meeting will include a quiz on the for-loop syntax and provide time for them to complete the programming project.

- *Quiz: For-loops*

### For the Teacher
- Preview the *Student Activity Guide: Lab Assignment - For-loops* tasks


## Getting Started (Day 1) (10 min)
### 1) Understanding the Lab Assignment – For-loops
- Lab Preview: The goal for this lab assignment is for students to be creative with picture manipulation using the skills and techniques learned in earlier lessons. If possible, instruct the students to either take a photograph to use in the lab or use a photo they already have. (An image is provided in the lesson resources.) Using skills they have practiced in earlier lesson, they will use FOR loops to make color changes and other manipulations to the images.
- Instruct the students to independently read the *Student Activity Guide: Lab Assignment - For-loops* document
- Ask 1 or 2 students to describe what they understand the task to be.  
- Answer questions.

## Activity: Lab Project (35 min)
### 2) Independent work on the lab assignment 
- Monitor student progress.
- Avoid answering questions directly; instead, ask the students questions that will guide them to being able to answer their own questions.

## Wrap-up (Day 1) (5 min)
### 3) Journal entry – Progress

- Instruct students to record their progress on the lab project in a journal entry. They should record what they have accomplished, and what their next steps will be, as well as any problems they encountered that they should research before the next class meeting.

### 4) Review for the quiz
- Assign students to review for the quiz on day 2 of this lesson by reviewing their journal entries, Student Activity documents, projects and notes from Lessons 8-12. This is intended to be an out-of-class activity. 

## Getting Started (Day 2) (10 min)
### 5) Progress re-check
- Direct students to review the journal notes made at the end of the last class meeting before they begin the last phase of the programming project. Include the question: How will you test your code for accuracy?
- Answer any questions that may pertain to the entire class. 

## Activity: Lab Project (35 min)
### 6) Quiz on For-loops
- Determine how you will collect student work for assessment. Ask students to complete the tasks on the computer using JavaScript and print the code, or observe on the monitor to verify that their programs work and record a score, or ask students to write the code in the space provided on the quiz document.
- Distribute the *Quiz*
- Answer any questions students may have about the tasks.

### 7) Independent work on the lab assignment 
- Monitor student progress.

## Wrap-up (Day 2) (5 min)
### 8) Experience summary  
- Direct students to respond to the following questions in their journals.
 - Identify one error or bug you encountered while working on the lab project. 
 - Describe the error and what you did to solve it. 
 - How did you test your program to ensure that it works correctly and solves the problem? 

- Assign students to complete the lab project outside of class if necessary.

# Teaching Tip
It is important that students are made aware that individual assessments are an important part of demonstrating their mastery of their knowledge and skills.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.


### Computer Art Show
Create a class art show. Using original photos, demonstrate your artistic and programming skills to creatively manipulate one or more images. Create a collage of the images, title your work. Display the art of the entire class in the classroom, online, in a school display venue, or other public arena. 


## Assessment Questions

- Print the phrase “I love computers” to the screen that 100 times.
- Print all the even numbers between 30 and 500.
- Ask the user for a number less than 100.  Print all numbers between the user input and 100. If the user enters 95, the output should be:
95  96  97  98  99  100
- Move a small image across a screen from left to right.

title: Card Sorting
description: "The algorithmic techniques and analysis involved in sorting data are seen over and over again in a variety of contexts. Sorting numbers in a list is challenging but foundational to many algorithms in computer science. This lesson is the first of several in which students explore and confront the difficulties of the problem of sorting in general and also the difficulties involved in expressing a clear algorithm for it.  The activities are also creative because there are many different ways to sort a list of things. The differences in students' solutions should provide good material for later discussions about algorithm analysis when we ask, --What is the 'best' way to sort?

title: Visualizing Data
description: "As more and more of data are collected, processed, and analyzed, there is a pressing need to present the results with simplicity and efficiency.  Visualizations are powerful tools for conveying large amounts of information to tell a story. Properly made visualizations can help the reader understand and retain the important ideas from the story being told. In this lesson, students will use visualizations generated by JavaScript commands with the Google Charts API in the Google Code Playground.

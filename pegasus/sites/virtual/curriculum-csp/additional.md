Code.org® has set out to write a comprehensive CS Principles curriculum developed specifically for high school setting one that is flexible and comfortable for both the "new-to-CS-Principles educator and the most experienced teacher. The course is being developed specifically to address the learning objectives of *Advance Placement CS Principles Framework*® in its most recent form - published by the College Board® in February 2014. The curriculum focuses on preparing students in the many skills they will need to succeed in the  various “Performance Tasks” in the future AP exam, as defined by the College Board.  

Throughout the development of this curriculum, writers have worked backward from the College Board’s curriculum framework, specifically the identified “learning objectives” and “essential knowledge” statements, grouping them into like-categories. As a result of this process, the curriculum follows a smooth sequence for teachers and students to follow which spirals throughout the units to progressively build students’ understanding and skills.  

Generally speaking, the lessons and activities are designed to leverage inquiry- and exploration-based teaching strategies designed to empower students to explore deeply, creatively, and independently.

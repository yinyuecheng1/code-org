## Lesson Overview (Assessment)

In this lesson, students will collaboratively solve a problem that requires them to apply their knowledge of sorting and searching. Student teams will be presented with a novel problem that requires organization of some data and then a plan for finding the "answer" to the problem. The task involves describing an algorithm and then arguing for its correctness and efficiency. This is an opportunity to practice skills that will be important for success in the innovations performance task later in the course.

## Teaching Summary
### **Getting Started** - 10 minutes

1) Understand the problem-solving task.

### **Activity: Collaborative Problem Solving** - 30 minutes  

2) Analyze the problem and plan a solution.

 (Under development) In the assessment students will:
	- develop an algorithm
	- describe in pseudo-code
	- describe running time
	- make small write-up visualization of solution


### **Wrap up** - 10 minutes
3) Finish the summary report.

## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- *Student Activity Guide: Assessment - Searching and Sorting* (under development)
- *Assessment Rubric* (under development)
 

### For the Teacher
- Prepare the student activity guides
- Log into website?
- Prep for using widget?

## Getting Started (10 min)
### 1) Understand the problem-solving task.
- Explain that today they will apply what they have learned about pseudocode, searching, and sorting to solve a new problem.
- Students will work with a partner to develop an algorithmic solution to solve the problem and write a summary of the process and their experiences.
- Set the expectations for any other requirements or restrictions during the assessment process.
- Distribute the problem statements.

## Activity: Collaborative Problem Solving (30 minutes)
### 2) Analyze the problem and plan a solution.
- (Under development)
- (Problems here should require some combination of searching and sorting to solve the problem. Perhaps something like a series of map-inverse-map problems set in different contexts.  
- Examples:  
 - find most 10 frequently occurring colors in an image
 - How many colors from one image occur in another?
 - find most 10 frequently occurring words in piece of text?
 - How many pieces of text from one document occur in another?
 - find most frequently occurring segment of DNA in a strand?
 - [Baker NOTE: these problems can be situated in interesting contexts]
	
- Students must:
 - develop an algorithm
 - write in pseudo-code
 - describe running time
 - produce a short written summary report or visualization of solution

# Teaching Tip
This assessment is similar to a mini-performance task. It requires that students be able to transfer their understanding of searching and sorting into new contexts. The problem also subtly requires students to recall knowledge of how data is structured. For example, an image can be viewed as a list of colors.

## Wrap-up (10 min)
### 3) Finish the summary report.
- This task can be assigned as homework.

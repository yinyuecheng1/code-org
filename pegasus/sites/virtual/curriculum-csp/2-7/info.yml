title: Assessment - Searching and Sorting
description: "In this lesson, students will collaboratively solve a problem that requires them to apply their knowledge of sorting and searching. Student teams will be presented with a novel problem that requires organization of some data and then a plan for finding the 'answer' to the problem. The task involves describing an algorithm and then arguing for its correctness and efficiency. This is an opportunity to practice skills that will be important for success in the innovations performance task later in the course.

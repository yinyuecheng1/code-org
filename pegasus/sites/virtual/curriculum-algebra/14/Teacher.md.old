### Common Core Mathematical Practices
 
- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
- 4. Model with mathematics.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- 7.EE.3-4: The student uses numerical and algebraic expressions and equations to solve real-life and mathematical problems.
- 8.F.1-3: The student defines, evaluates, and compares functions.
- A-CED.1-4: The student solves equations and inequalities in one or more variable that describe numbers or relationships.
- A-SSE.1-2: The student interprets the structure of expressions to solve problems in context.
- F-IF.1-3: The student uses function notation to describe, evaluate, and interpret functions in terms of domain and range.
- F-IF.4-6: The student interprets the behavior of functions that arise in applications in terms of the context.

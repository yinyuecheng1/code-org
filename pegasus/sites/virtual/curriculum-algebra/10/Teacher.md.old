# Teaching Guide

## Getting Started


### <a name="GetStarted"></a> 1) Introduction

Functions are a key part of animation in computer programs. A function that draws a static picture of a bat, for example, can place the bat at a different location based on the input. When that input changes slightly based on time or user-interaction, the bat will appear to move. This is similar to the way that flip-book animations work, in which each page draws a static image that has changed by a small amount. When the pages are displayed quickly, the images appear to change smoothly.

<img src="bat_spritesheet.png" style="width: 100%" />

Putting these images together, we arrive at an animation of the bat turning around.

<img src="bat_animated_fast.gif" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"/>

## Activity: Play Lab Design Recipe
### <a name="Activity1"></a> 2) Online Puzzles

In this stage you'll write functions that manipulate images to create animations. Head to [MSM stage 10](http://studio.code.org/s/algebra/stage/10/puzzle/1) in Code Studio to get started programming.

<summary>Standards Alignment</summary>

### Common Core Mathematical Practices
 
- 1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- 2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- 3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
- 4. Model with mathematics.
- 5. Use appropriate tools strategically.
- 6. Attend to precision.
- 7. Look for and make use of structure.
- 8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

### Common Core Math Standards

- 8.F.1-3: The student defines, evaluates, and compares functions.
- A-SSE.1-2: The student interprets the structure of expressions to solve problems in context.
- F-BF.3-4: The student builds new functions from existing functions.
- F-IF.1-3: The student uses function notation to describe, evaluate, and interpret functions in terms of domain and range.
- F-IF.4-6: The student interprets the behavior of functions that arise in applications in terms of the context.

## Lesson Overview (Discovery, New Learning, Guided Practice, Creative, Assessment -pick one)
Understanding the binary number system is foundational to understanding how computers work and what they can, and cannot, do. The goal is not to simply teach how to translate numbers from one representation to another, but to introduce the concepts of abstraction and algorithms. The activities in Lesson 4 guide students to construct and internalize their own understanding of the binary number system.

# Teaching Guide
## Materials, Resources and Prep
### For the Student
- Student Activity Guide: Analog Binary Calculator, preferably on cardstock
- Student Activity Guide: Binary Practice
- Student Journal

### For the Teacher
- Classroom set of scissors and markers
- Hexadecimal cups: a set for each group of three students
- Provide copies of the Student Activity Guides
- Optional: punch cards 

## Getting Started (15 min)
### 1) Light Switch
- Instruct students to answer these questions with an elbow partner:
	- “Using a single light switch, how can you represent the value 0? 1? 
	- If you have two light switches, how many values can you represent? Describe how you would represent each value.”
- Invite students to share their ideas.
- Engage the entire class with the following questions. Show the various combinations.
	- “If I add a third switch, how many values can I represent? 
	- How many can I represent with 4 switches? Do you notice a pattern?”

# Teaching Tip
Guiding the students towards understanding that the number of switches determines how many numbers can be represented. The pattern is 1 switch = 2 (2^1) numbers, 2 switches = 4 (2^2), 3 switches = 8 (2^3), etc.

## Activity: Storing patterns with the Jacquard loom (30 min)
### 2) Jacquard Loom: Early Computer Programming

- View the video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwozgRPLVC8]().  If you have punch cards, pass them around while students are watching the video.
- Prompt students to respond in their journals: “Describe how patterns are stored and reused in the Jacquard loom? 

## Wrap-up (5 min)
### 4) Reflection 
3) In the student journal, complete this statement " The Jacquard loom represent a break-through in computer history because..."

# Teaching Tip  
Model writing skills through the journal entries. Use a variety of prompts that encourage students write complete sentences that clearly communicate their ideas.

## Extended Learning 
Use these activities to enhance student learning. They can be used as outside of class activities or other enrichment.

### Weaving

- Follow the directions to create a small weaving project while watching the video of the Jacquard Loom: [http://tinyurl.com/m5cekcf]()
- Prompt students to respond in their journals: How did the invention of the weaving loom change society? How are these changes similar to those brought by computing technology?

### MP3 Music compression

- Read or listen to the NPR broadcast on MP3 files: [http://tinyurl.com/myag43c]()
- Journal entry: Record your reaction.

## Assessment Questions
- Why is the binary number system used in computers?
- In your own words, describe the pattern for even and odd numbers in binary. Why do you think this happens?

## Connections and Background Information
 CS Principle Learning Objectives:

- 2.1.1 Describe the combination of abstractions used to represent data.  
- 2.1.2 Explain how binary sequences are used to represent digital data.  
- 2.2.2 Use multiple levels of abstraction in computation.  

The activities in Lesson 4 support CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards:
 
- CT.L3A-05. Describe the relationship between binary and hexadecimal representations.  
- CT.L3A-09. Describe the value of abstraction to manage problem complexity.  
- CT.L3B-04. Evaluate algorithms by their efficiency, correctness, and clarity.  
- CT.L3B-07. Discuss the interpretation of binary sequences in a variety of forms.

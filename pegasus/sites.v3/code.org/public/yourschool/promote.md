# Help us compile the  K-12 Computer Science Access Report

This year, the Computer Science Teachers’ Association and Code.org are partnering to create the [K-12 Computer Science Access Report](https://code.org/yourschool/about), the first-ever comprehensive report of which schools offer computer science in the US. 

We are using a combination of crowdsourced teacher surveys, data from curriculum providers like the College Board, and data from state departments of education to get information about every school in the country. Check out the map at [code.org/yourschool](https://code.org/yourschool#map) to see data we've gathered so far. This data can be incredibly powerful in identifying which areas across the US need help and will ultimately help provide opportunities for students to learn computer science. The more robust the data we compile, the more schools and students we can reach in our efforts to expand access to computer science, and that’s why we need your help. 

## How can you or your organization help?

* Look up schools in your area [on our map](https://code.org/yourschool#map) and fill out our survey for each.
* Send a newsletter or email to your network that includes a request to fill out Code.org’s survey - sample language below
* Share the page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcode.org%2Fyourschool) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?related=codeorg&text=Does+your+school+teach+computer+science%3F+Expand+computer+science+at+your+school+or+district.+%40codeorg&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcode.org%2Fyourschool)

## Email newsletters to teachers or administrators:

_Below, find some **examples of language** you can use to promote the access report to teachers and educators. If you send out a regular newsletter, we highly encourage you to include multiple reminders:_

__Subject: Does your school teach computer science?__

Code.org and the Computer Science Teachers Association are gathering data from every school in the country to determine how widely computer science is taught. This data will help allocate resources and focus activities in the effort to provide equitable access to computer science for all students. Can you please help by filling out the 5-minute survey for your school at [code.org/yourschool](https://code.org/yourschool#map)?

__Subject: We want to celebrate schools that teach computer science!__

## Email newsletter to parents:

_Include this language in a newsletter that is primarily read by parents or computer science education advocates:_

__Subject: Does your school teach computer science?__

This year, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) and Code.org are partnering to create a database of K-12 schools in the US offering computer science, and they need your help! Volunteers around the country are reaching out to their schools or their kids’ schools,  asking teachers to fill out a short survey about computer science opportunities at the school. Volunteering takes just a few minutes – just locate your school on the map, and if data is needed for the school, copy the email template, and send it to a teacher at the school! You can volunteer anytime from anywhere and it only takes a few minutes to do.

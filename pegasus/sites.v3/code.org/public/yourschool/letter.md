## Subject: Does our school teach CS?

Dear **[Teacher/Counselor/Principal]**,

The Computer Science Teachers Association and Code.org are working to gather data from every school in the country about the types of computer science activities offered. This data will help organizations like the CSTA and Code.org give schools the support they need by allocating resources and focusing efforts in their shared mission to provide equitable access to computer science for all students.  I noticed that they donâ€™t have information on our school yet. 
<br/>
<br/>

**Can you please help by filling out the 5-minute survey for our school at [code.org/yourschool](https://code.org/yourschool#form)?**
<br/>
<br/>

Code.org also has great resources to help expand computer science in our schools at no cost in most regions. They offer: 

- [Curriculum](https://code.org/educate) for a full K-12 computer science pathway
- [Workshops](https://code.org/educate/professional-learning) to prepare a teacher of any subject to begin teaching computer science
- [Resources](https://code.org/administrators) to help administrators plan to add computer science to the school day.
- There are also a variety of options offered by [other organizations](http://code.org/educate/3rdparty). 

Thank you,

The Hour of Code volunteer in a classroom program gives your employees the opportunity to be a guest speaker and help students through online tutorials in their local classrooms or via video call. This opportunity is provided year-round, however, the demand for volunteers in our teachers' classrooms is much higher in December during Computer Science Education Week.

**Past volunteer testimony:**

- “The best part of my experience was that the entire class were women and people of color. **It bodes well for the future of our industry** to have a chance to reach and excite these kids.”
- “Especially enjoyed getting to **encourage young girls in tech**. Felt like I was helping the next generation in my local area.”
- “I LOVED seeing how excited the kids were. One amazing thing was that the teachers noticed that some of the **students who didn’t do as well academically were excelling** at thinking like a developer and helping others - giving them a place to feel confident.”

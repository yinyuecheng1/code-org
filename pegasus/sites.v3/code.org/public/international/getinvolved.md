## Host an Hour of Code anytime, anywhere 

The [Hour of Code](https://hourofcode.com) is the largest learning event in history. Since it first launched in 2013, it has become a truly global movement, reaching tens of millions of students in more than 180 countries. People of all ages have tried the Hour of Code, a one-hour course designed to demystify computer science and show that anybody can learn the basics. Hour of Code events can happen anytime, anywhere.

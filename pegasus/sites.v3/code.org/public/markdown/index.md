# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to format your pages. You can review this guide for how to use Markdown to format your pages. As a general rule of thumb, find another Code.org page with an example of what you need to do. Then go find the Markdown file in Dropbox and see the code to do it. You can always ask another employee if you have any questions. Happy editing!

# How to set up your classroom

## **Create a Code Studio account**

Before you can set up a class, make sure you have a teacher Code Studio account.  If you don’t already have an account, you can sign up from [here](https://studio.code.org/users/sign_up).  Make sure to choose the “Teacher” account type in the sign up form.

## **Create a new section and assign a tutorial**
 
1. When you log on, you’ll start at your “Teacher homepage.” Click on “Student Accounts and Progress” to create a section and assign the tutorial.  You can also just go directly to this [link](/teacher-dashboard#/sections).
1. Click on the “New section” button you see at the top left (see Image 1).
1. Give your section a name, pick the login type (generally “picture” for younger students), and choose the grade (see Image 2).
1. For “Course,” pick the appropriate course you chose for your coding club in the dropdown.
1. Check “Stage Extras” so that students who finish a lesson early can work on projects while they wait for other students to finish.  
1. Once you set up your section, hit “Save” to finish creating your section.

## **Add students to your section (picture or word login type)**

1. If you chose “picture” or “word” login type, you can manually add students to your section to auto-create their accounts.
1. To do this, first click on “Manage students” below your section name (see Image 3).
1. This will take you to a page where you’ll be able to see a list of all your students. To quickly add students, click on the “Add multiple students” button (see Image 4).
1. You should get a box that lets you type in your students’ names. Simply type one per line and hit “Done” (see Image 5). 
1. Input your students’ ages and gender, and hit “Save all.” You now have a section with all your students!
1. Print out cards for your students’ login information by choosing that option under the section URL link in the “Manage students” tab (see Image 6).

## **Add students to your section (email login type)**

1. If you chose the “email” login type, students will need to create their own accounts either from [here](https://studio.code.org/users/sign_up) or via Clever, if you are doing your program in partnership with a school that uses Clever.
1. They can then join in your section by going to your section link (which can be found by clicking on the “Manage students” link under the given section on [this page](/teacher-dashboard#/sections)) (see Image 7).
1. Look for the link for your students to join your section at the bottom of the page (see Image 8).

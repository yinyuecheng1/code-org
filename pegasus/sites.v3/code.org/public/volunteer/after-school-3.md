# Implementation Guidance
## How to set up your program
Code.org’s Computer Science Fundamentals curriculum can be accessed within Code.org’s online education platform. This curriculum is available at no cost for the volunteers and after school organizations. It consists of multiple courses, each of which has about 20 lessons that may be implemented and adapted based on the length of your program.

**Hardware**

Code.org works on all browsers and on any kind of computer or tablet: Cromebooks, windows, ipads, android, etc. You’ll need computers/tablets for at least 50% of the class, and headphones are nice but not required. 

Don’t worry if computers are in short supply, your students can work in pairs with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgkahOzFH2Q" target="_blank">pair programming</a>! This is a great way for students to partner up and help each other through the exercises while relying on each other and less on the instructors. They will also see that computer science is social and collaborative.

<br>
<br>
**Internet Access**

You’ll need internet access for at least 50% of the class sessions. We suggest utilizing “[unplugged](/curriculum/unplugged)” activities throughout the course. These are hands on exercises that foster collaboration and don’t require a computer or internet access.

Don’t forget to check to make sure Code.org is not blocked! Check out our [IT Requirements](/educate/it) page for more information.

**Timing**

Recommendation: 45-60 minute class once per week for 20 weeks.  But, there are a lot of ways the coding club can be structured and it will vary from club to club depending on you and the partner organization’s capacity. The curriculum materials are flexible and can be taught in longer/shorter blocks - the curriculum and resources are here to help guide you, but we suggest that you go through the materials provided with your “co-teacher” and make them your own. 

If for some reason you can only hold one or two sessions for the students, we suggest going through one of the many Hour of Code [tutorials](/learn) instead of the full curriculum.

**Picking the right course for your students**

* Pre readers: [Course 1](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school#course1)
* Beginners in elementary school: [Course 2](/educate/curriculum/elementary-school#course2) (and then move onto Courses 3 and 4 for your next session)
* Middle school or high school: [Accelerated course](/educate/curriculum/accelerated-course)

We strongly encourage you to try the courses while structuring your coding club. This will help you get a sense of what your students will be doing and learning.

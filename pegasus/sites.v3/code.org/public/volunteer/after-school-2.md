Subject Line: Bring computer science to [ORGANIZATION]!

Dear [NAME],

Computer science is foundational knowledge for all students in the 21st century, but most schools don’t teach it--especially at the elementary level. In a Gallup poll, 9 out of 10 parents wanted their child to take computer science. Have you looked into offering a computer science after school club or integrating it into your existing program? 

If your team doesn’t have experience with computer science, we’d like to help you get started at no cost to you. In partnership with [COMPANY] and Code.org resources, we can launch a fun and innovative after school program focused on teaching computer science for K-12 students. [COMPANY] is dedicated to giving back to our local communities and believes computer science education is crucial in order to give every student the opportunity to succeed.

[COMPANY] will provide volunteers and a co-teacher to help run the after school program. This co-teacher can help with implementation, support, and guidance. [ORGANIZATION] only needs to provide a room, computers for the children, and a teacher/counselor to manage the classroom. The teacher needs no experience with computer science - we’ll help with that part.

I would love to set up a meeting to discuss this opportunity and partnership with you. Please let me know if there is a time in the next week to connect.

Thank you for considering bringing these life-changing skills to our children! I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,
<br>SIGNED

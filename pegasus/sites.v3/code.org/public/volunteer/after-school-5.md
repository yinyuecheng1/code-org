We’ve provided detailed lesson plans to help you structure your class time. Log in with your teacher account, go to the “courses” button. Click “view” on the course of your choice. From the teacher account, you’ll see links to the lesson plans for each lesson in the course. 

## Teaching Tips

Although you may be an experienced engineer or teacher, we suggest that you familiarize yourself with the curriculum and look over the teaching resources below.

| Tip | Example |
|-----|-----|
| Describe programs as instructions to connect programming with students’ every day lift | Programming is just bossing a computer around! |
| Point out products of CS to help students see computing around them | Traffic lights are controlled by computer programs! |
| Explain that bugs are expected to encourage students to embrace mistakes | Even for professional programmers, programs never work at first! |
| Introduce synonyms for CS to demystify terms describing CS jobs | There are lots of names to describe doing CS! |
| Promote collaboration & creativity to dispel stereotypes about CS | You’ll work together today like computer scientists do! |
| Model programming to show problem solving strategies | That didn’t work like I expected! What could I try next? |
| Publicize resources for learning CS to help students see how they can continue learning CS | If you want to learn more CS, you can find resources at [X] |

# Aligned with CSF

## What it means

When a curriculum boasts one of our “Aligned with Computer Science Fundamentals” logos, it means that the producers worked with Code.org to follow a series of requirements aimed at linking their offerings to a specific Code.org course.

These requirements include:

* Ensuring that the activities build upon one or more course in Computer Science Fundamentals in a meaningful way
* Offering helpful resources to allow teachers to transition from the Code.org course to the aligned course
* Posting a dated document that crosswalks the concepts of the aligned course to the appropriate CS Fundamentals course
* Allowing Code.org to review the final aligned curriculum for consistency

## What it is not

Please be advised that the “Aligned with Computer Science Fundamentals” logo is neither an implicit nor explicit recommendation of the aligned course.  Formal recommendations of third party curricula can be found [on our website](https://code.org/educate/curriculum/3rd-party), and is based on internal curation by multiple members of our education team.

## How is it awarded

Since Computer Science Fundamentals does not offer any lessons that require the purchase of additional electronic equipment, our “Aligned with Computer Science Fundamentals” logo is currently only available to producers who provide substantial offerings in robotics or hardware.

If a producer is interested in aligning their work to CS Fundamentals, they are encouraged to work with a member of our education team to scope out the product series tagged for alignment. Once the outline has been agreed upon, the producer will work to create required materials before reconnecting with the Code.org education team for final review.  A rough outline of those steps is provided below: 

* Consult with Code.org education team prior to lesson creation
* Complete crosswalk document aligning activities and objectives with CSF lessons
* Create lessons
* Create transitional materials
* Submit to Code.org for review
* Address any concerns raised by Code.org education team
* Receive and place “Aligned with Computer Science Fundamentals” logo

# School Districts & Code.org
Beginning in 2013, Code.org  partnered with school districts that teach almost **10%** of all U.S. students, and almost **15%** of the nation's Hispanic and African American students. As interest skyrocketed, we moved from direct partnership to a regional partner model. 

Now, districts can partner and work with a Code.org Regional Partner, a local organization in their area. 74 districts are working with Code.org Regional Partners and have pledged to expand computer science education in their schools.   

Learn how our regional partners [help expand computer science offerings in your school or district](/administrators). Or, you can get started yourself to help bring computer science to your school or district. [Sign the pledge and learn more here](/yourschool).

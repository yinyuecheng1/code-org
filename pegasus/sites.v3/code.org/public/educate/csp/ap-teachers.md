# Sign up your students for the AP CS Principles Exam

<img src="/images/csp-hof-2.png" width="100%"/>

Did you know that girls and students of color are less likely to take the AP exam? Even if they are enrolled in the course, many of these students won’t get credit for their work at the college level because they don’t take the exam. Female students account for only 27% of all students taking AP Computer Science exams and underrepresented minorities make up just 20%. 

Teachers and parents are key to motivating students to try the exam. Join the 350+ teachers at schools in our [AP CS Principles Hall of Fame](/educate/csp/hall-of-fame) who have helped lead record-breaking change in computer science by encouraging girls and underrepresented minorities in their classrooms.

Taking the exam can save your students money in college credits, help in applications, and, even if they don't pass, [preparing for and taking the exam has been shown to set students up for success](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED519365.pdf) in higher education. 

# So, how can you get your students to sign up?

Consider trying one of these techniques from our Hall of Fame teachers to encourage the students in your class:

## 1. Play this video in your class</h2>

<div class="col-50", style="padding-right:20px;">

<%=view :display_video_thumbnail, id: "ap_students", video_code: "-v7XswGX1vM", play_button: 'center', letterbox: 'false' %>

</div>

[col-50]

[/col-50]

<div style="clear: both;"></div>

## 2. Send home this flyer 

Or share <a href="https://code.org/educate/csp/ap-students", target=_"blank">this link</a>.

## 3. Give students extra credit for taking the exam

Recognize their hard work by offering a few bonus points. They'll thank you for it!

## 4. Encourage students to spread the word

Have some of your students already signed up? Encourage them to tell other students in the class that they are taking the exam and inspire their friends (on social media or in the class).

## 5. Send individual emails or encourage students in your class 1:1 to take the exam 

This can be especially valuable with the girls or underrepresented minorities in your class. They are less likely to be given personal encouragement by teachers and parents, and your support can really boost their confidence.

## No idea what your major will be?

Passing an AP Exam can help you **complete your college's general education requirements**, opening up more time for you to explore what you want to pursue.

## Worried you won't pass?

That's fine! **You don't need to report your test scores** to the colleges you apply to. And, even just preparing for and taking the exam will help you build the skills you'll need throughout college.

## Be a part of history

Female students still account for only 27% of all students taking AP CS Exams and underrepresented minorities make up just 20%. **It's time we change this**.

## Need help paying for the exam?

Financial obligations shouldn't prevent you from taking an AP Exam. Talk with your teacher or school counselor to learn about **financial assistance**.

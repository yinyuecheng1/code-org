Kimberly is a 5th grade teacher with Victor Elementary School District. She has enjoyed her teaching career for 32 years in both Texas and California. Since the very beginning of her career, she incorporated computer programming into her classroom using Commodore 64s and Apple 2Es using the LOGO program. Through LOGO, she taught her students art, problem-solving, teamwork, math, and geometry.  Kimberly truly believes in helping fellow teachers work smarter not harder. Her workshops, therefore, include ways to incorporate coding into all other subject areas. When she's not teaching or presenting Code.org workshop, she volunteers with her husband for LoveHopeStrength, by going to concerts and getting people registered on the international bone marrow donor list to save lives from blood and bone cancers.

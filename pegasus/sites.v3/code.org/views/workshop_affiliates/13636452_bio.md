As your facilitator you need to know that I am here to empower you in the area of teaching computer science.  For some of you, you will be excited about the opportunity to deliver this curriculum to your students, but for others you may be apprehensive about the thought of teaching computer science. I will do my best to equip you and excite you about teaching the computer science Code.org curriculum.  My desire is for you to walk away from the training with the ability to hit the ground running, knowing that if you have hiccups along the way, you have someone who will support you.    A bit of personal information about me is that I didnâ€™t start my career off as a teacher; I was a computer programmer and a business owner first.  I have a B.S in Computer Informational Systems, a B.S in Business/Technology Teaching and a M.A. in Special Education.  I have taught at the elementary, middle school and high school level, in the areas of finance, business, computer science, engineering and bio-medical.  I have been married for 28 years.  My husband and I have three kids, and a dog.  I am first generation American, my mom came here from Germany after WWII and my husband is originally from Jamaica.

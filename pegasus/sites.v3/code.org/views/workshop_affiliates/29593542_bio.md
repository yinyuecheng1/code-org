For over ten years, Stephen has devoted his time to training and partnering with educators in developing key literacy and technology skills in order to enhance student learning in the classroom and libraries around the world. In 2014, Stephen discovered the maker movement when he was asked to lead the development of his library’s first makerspace. Once he saw the powerful impact  of STEM and Project-based learning on students’ lives, he never looked back. Today, Stephen serves as Director of Education for the Club for Boys in Rapid City, South Dakota. Currently, he is focused on transforming the library to the X:Lab — a 21st STEM learning center where all boys can engage in computer science, robotics, circuitry, 3D printing and so much more.

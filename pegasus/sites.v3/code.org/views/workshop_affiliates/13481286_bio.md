I am a veteran teacher of 17+ years. 15 of those years were dedicated to teaching language arts. In 2007, I received a masters degree in educational technology. Soon after I began teaching applications courses along with my language arts courses. Two years ago, I was moved into teaching technology full time. Last year, I attended TeacherCon and taught CS Discoveries. Not having a background in computer science, I was nervous about teaching the content. However, I learned, as you will, being a lead learner is a great way to teach! CS Discoveries is a teacher friendly curriculum that you will love! I am looking forward to guiding others in their journey through the program!

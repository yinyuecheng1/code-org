After having taught ELA for 20+ years, I jumped at the chance to teach computer science and learn something new. I knew nothing about CS, and loved learning with my students in the first year teaching CS Discoveries. Being a facilitator helps me learn even more! I live outside Louisville, Kentucky, with three dogs and a cat.

Melanie VonBraunsberg CTE Teacher at A.L. Stanback Middle School in Orange County N.C. I have taught High School for three and a half years and have been teaching middle school for four years now, going into my fifth year.   We started incorporating code into the classroom a couple of years ago and now that we are using code.org, it has been much more enjoyable and our students want to learn more about coding and all the wonderful things they can do.

I have taught Computer Science for 5 years in a very small, very rural school district. I have enjoyed bringing these skills to our youth.  Preparing our youth with knowledge and skills that can be marketable is key to our future success.  I am excited to support other teachers in bringing Computer Science and Computational Thinking skills to their students.  There are 4 boys who call me "momma" and in my spare time I enjoy being on the ranch with my husband and boys. I also enjoy learning and evolving my knowledge.

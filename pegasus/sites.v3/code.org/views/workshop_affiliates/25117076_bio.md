I am Billie Dollins Jent.  I was born and raised in Michigan.  I met my husband while attending college at Central Michigan University.   I taught 7th grade science for three years in Michigan.  We moved to South Florida in 2005, when my husband got a job at the University of Miami.  I started teaching at 8th grade science at Coral Springs Middle School that same year.  I have a total of 15 years of teaching experience.  Last year was my first year teaching computer science.  I am the science department chair at my school.  I have an 11 year old son named Jack.  I am actively involved as a high school youth group volunteer at my church.

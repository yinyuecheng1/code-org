 I am a Computer Science at West Middle School (a STEM school) in Grand Junction Colorado.  I just completed my 16th year of teaching.  In the past I have taught science or math.  Three years ago, I was asked to be the Computer Science teacher and LOVE it.  My students consist of 6th, 7th & 8th grade students.  They come into my class with little to no background in computer science.  I have kids of ALL, and I mean ALL, levels in this class.   I am married, and my wifeâ€™s name is Tara.  I have two great step kids Faith and Ben.  Faith is a senior and Ben will be going into 8th grade.  Ben plays Lacrosse and we spend a lot of time in the spring going around Colorado and Utah to watch him play.   I am also actively involved in the sport of swimming and diving (I have participated in both but am more a diver).  I have been asked to officiate at the Colorado High School State Meet 4 times, and the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference Championships 5 times.  GO BRONCOS! GO ROCKIES! GO AVALANCHE! GO NUGGETS!

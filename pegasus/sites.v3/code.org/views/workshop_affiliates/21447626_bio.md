I work with adults and K-12 students in implementing project-based learning into curriculum to make abstract concepts more tangible and concrete.  Using project-based learning allows students to inquire and explore topics with much greater detail and less restriction than "traditional" classroom instructional practices.  My work within my current organization has created new networks and professional opportunities based on my passion and knowledge of this style of instructional practice.  I believe that STEM is not an acronym but rather a philosophical process that aims to infuse real-world, cross-curricular practices into all content areas; not just the letters in the acronym.  I am always looking to expand my knowledge base and network of teachers and administration to continue integrating hands-on learning experiences into all classrooms.

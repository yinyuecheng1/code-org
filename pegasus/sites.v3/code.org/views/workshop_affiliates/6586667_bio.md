Dianne Rae is an entrepreneur turned educator. Since becoming an EL teacher, she has taught all ages from K- 12, but her favorite is to teach kindergarteners and newcomers. Along with teaching foundational literacy skills, Dianne has discovered that her new favorite literacy skill to teach is coding. Yes, coding is a new literacy skill for the 21st century and just as we start teaching kids how to read and write in early childhood, we need to start teaching coding early. Dianne has had great success teaching coding in her K-4 elementary school and now wants to share this success with other elementary teachers by facilitating Code.org workshops. She was a member of the 2016 -17 MN Coding in the Classroom Leadership Cohort and is now a member of the Cohort Advisory Board, has a BA from the University of SD and an MEd from the University of MN.

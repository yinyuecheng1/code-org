I'm currently the Coordinator of Media and Instructional Technology for the Baltimore City Public Schools, where I have worked in a variety of roles for just about 28 years. I got involved with coding a few years ago after a conversation with a district partner who was talking about tech jobs that are available in the region for people with a diploma and coding experience.  The more I learned about the benefits of computational thinking, the more I realized that coding should be a requirement for all kids.

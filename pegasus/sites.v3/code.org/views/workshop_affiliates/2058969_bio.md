The mystery of how things work has always been my passion in life. So, why not teach Science was my philosophy for going into education.  I am an 18-year veteran to education. The majority of my time has been spent increasing my knowledge and skills in working with diverse learners. I went back to school to obtain a Masterâ€™s degree in Special Education.  My thirst for knowledge still has not stopped.  In the last five years, I have moved into the world of Engineering, which opened up a new level of investigation that I had never imagined.  My curiosity has now brought me to teaching Engineering and introducing students to Computer Programming with Code.org.

Natalie is a mathematics and CTE teacher at Bryant TEC (The Enrichment Cooperative), a K-12 parent-partnership public school, in Spokane, Washington. She has been teaching at Bryant TEC since 2013. Computer science is a passion for Natalie and she loves incorporating new ways for her students to explore the various applications of this field. In addition to her Middle School and High School CS and Web Design classes, she also teaches the after school 4th-8th grade FIRST LEGO League (1st semester) and Coding Club (2nd semester). Natalie believes that every student should have the opportunity to learn computer science and that computer science is a job skill that every student should graduate knowing. In her free time, Natalie practices Kendo (Japanese sword fighting), creates tatted lace, plays guitar/sings in a band called Infilktion, hosts weekly game nights, and, as her husband puts it, collects hobbies.

I am a secondary classroom teacher at an alternative high school. I've been teaching for 8 years in Utah and was a permanent substitute teacher in Michigan for 10+ years. I have taught Computer Technology, Entrepreneurship, Marketing, Customer Service, Leadership Principles, Computer Science Principles, Desktop Publishing, Business Web Page Design, Computer Programming I, Business Communications, Exploring Computer Science and Student Council. I am the FBLA advisor for our school and you will often find me problem solving computer issues for other teachers or managing the school's website. I love to work with alternative high school students and help them see a future in computers regardless of their life experiences to this point. I have been facilitating for Code.org for the past 2 years to share my passion about computer science and providing equal access to all.

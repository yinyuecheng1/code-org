Hi my name is Denise Fountain, I have been teaching for 21 years. But I  have only been teaching computer science for 3 years. I cutrently teach two pathways: programming and computer science. I have also presented at many GACTE conferences on legal enviromental issues. I just completed my CS endorsement and Java still is a hard language to teach and learn. I truly enjoy using code.org in my computer science principles class. So easy comes with everything a teacher needs and the non computer lessons give tje kids a break from the computer occasionally.  I just truly love teaching.

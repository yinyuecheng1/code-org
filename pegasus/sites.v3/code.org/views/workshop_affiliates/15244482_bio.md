 Since my first Apple IIe, I have had a symbiotic relationship with technology. For 25 years I have taught the spectrum of mathematics through AP Calculus interspersed with CAD, Engineering Principles and AP Computer Science. More importantly, I am the proud father of three geeky engineers-in-the-making.

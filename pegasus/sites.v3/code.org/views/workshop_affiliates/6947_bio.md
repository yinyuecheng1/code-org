Susan has enjoyed teaching & witnessing how computer education has evolved over the past 20 years. She has Masters' Degrees in both Communications and Instructional Technology from the University of MA at Amherst and Framingham University.  She teaches at  Dupont Middle School in Chicopee MA and runs a growing Girls Who Code club with a small group of enthusiastic girls.   Using the Computer Science Discoveries curriculum has become an exciting program at her school in which her students are preparing to understand the world of Computer Science.  She looks forward to working with teachers who are also interested in providing their students with opportunities to understand Computer Science.  In her spare time, Susan enjoys her two beautiful  grandchildren and activities with her friends.

I am currently in my 25th year of teaching. I have taught 2nd and 3rd grades, as well as, technology in a lab. I have been a co-teaching technology specialist with teachers in my building for the past 13 years. I love teaching students and adults and have had the opportunity to lead professional development in my building, district, as well as, outside of my district. I'm a Code.org Facilitator, Seesaw Ambassador, Level 1-Google Certified Educator, and a Certified BrainPOP Teacher. I'm thrilled to share my passion and excitement for computer science with you!

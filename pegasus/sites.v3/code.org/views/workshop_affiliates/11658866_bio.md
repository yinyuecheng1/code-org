In addition to being a facilitator for Code.org, I am teach 5th Grade Programming and 7th and 8th Grade Digital Media at my middle school.  I have been in the Education field for 38 years and have been involved with technology in schools for the last 30 years. I have taught K-8 Technology, was a full time 5th and 6th grade teacher and haver been a Technology TOSA - teaching teachers how to integrate and infuse technology into their classroom and curriculum.

I did Hour of Code with some of my students a few years ago and saw how engaged they became when coding. I believe that all students should have the opportunity to learn and use coding during their education and that it develops thinking skills that are students need for the future.

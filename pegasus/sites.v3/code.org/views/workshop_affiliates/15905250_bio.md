Sherry has been both a computer and business teacher at the Middle School and High School Levels for several years. She currently works at Garnet Valley Middle School. She enthusiastically teaches the Code.org Curriculum as well as various software, apps and technologies to over 600 students annually. She successfully worked in the business world for 15 years prior to becoming a teacher, so she is quite comfortable working with both adults and students. She is really excited to work with other teachers and is passionate about computer science and bringing this hands-on, interactive curriculum into many more classrooms. She holds an M.B.A., in addition to teaching certifications in B.C.I.T (Business, Computers & Information Technology), English, and Special Education. She is currently pursuing her TESL (Teaching English as a Second Language Certification) at West Chester University. Her hobbies include: travel, rollerblading and reading.

I teach Middle School Elective classes: PLTW Gateway Engineering and Design, Intro to Computers and Technology, and Computer Science Discoveries. I teach kids to use computers, code, 3D model and 3D print, build robots, and so much more. I also coach lego robotics after school every year. In my off time, I play video games, card games and board games, read scary books, and get outside! I love to hike and get into nature any chance I get. I have lived in California my whole life, and have explored quite a bit of it, but still have lots left to see and do. I call Fresno home, and do not see myself ever moving from here. I am married and have two fur-babies. I want to take classes to get an add on credential for computer science, and am also working on Microsoft's Innovative Educator program.

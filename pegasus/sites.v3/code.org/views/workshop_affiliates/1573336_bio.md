Autumn has been a STEM, Computer Science, Digital Art, and Keyboarding guru for seven years!  She teaches at Thomas Hunter Middle School in a very rural area of Virginia.  She built the division’s middle school STEM and Computer Science program from the ground up and has become an outspoken advocate for STEM and Computer Science education. Her passion is almost visible and she hopes she can inspire you to bring Computer Science to your classroom!  Autumn holds an M. Ed in Education in Technology and is certified in Virginia to teach Computer Science and Keyboarding.  She also works as a teacher at CodeVa, CODE’s regional partner in Virginia, as a summer camp teacher.  She frequently says the kids teach her more than she could ever teach them!  In fact, this is how her classroom works as well.  Everyone learns together.  In her spare time, Autumn loves to draw, play games, imagine she is a super hero with her nephews, and spend time with her husband and cat.

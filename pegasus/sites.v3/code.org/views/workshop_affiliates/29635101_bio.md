My name is Haley Meyer and I am finishing my 4th year of teaching Computer Science. This is my 2nd year at Damonte Ranch High School in Reno, Nevada and I love being part of such an innovative, creative, and fun work environment. I graduated from Montana State University in 2014 with a BS in Health Enhancement and minors in Technology Education and Coaching. I have really enjoyed taking the Computer Science path but also enjoy coaching and being involved with athletics. I believe both these areas are vital for the future of our students. Physical health and knowledge of technology and innovation will be increasingly useful. I currently teach Computer Science I and Yearbook and next year will be teaching APCSA. I am excited for this change and think the material and curriculum will be great for the kids and teachers. In my free time I love to ski, camp, hike, travel, and spend lots of time outside!

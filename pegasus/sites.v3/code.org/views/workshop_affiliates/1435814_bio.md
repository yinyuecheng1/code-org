My name is Susie Scanapieco. I am a wife, a mom, an educator and a full-time #mathgeek.  My personal mission is to have children learn developmentally appropriate math from a very early age so they can become confident and have a strong numeric foundation; both essential to be successful in a modern era of STEM [Science, Technology, Engineering, Math] careers. I am certified to teach math to grades 5-12 and have worked as a math specialist in a both middle & high school RTI.  In addition to working currently as the STEM Specialist in my district, I own a math tutoring agency, the math helpER+, to extend my love of teaching math to include K-4.  As the STEM Specialist in my district, we are always looking to adopt new programs.  Two years ago we were one of the first districts to have full implementation of CS4RI, in which all students K-12 had access to computer science opportunities. This year we added and I taught a new innovation/entrepreneurship class called INCubatoredu.  I am also responsible for facilitating district professional development and am a mentor to new teachers.  I am eager to become a part of the code.org world!

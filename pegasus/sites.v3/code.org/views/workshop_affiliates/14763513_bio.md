Michael has been a Mathematics teacher for 17 years at the secondary level for Detroit Public Schools (9 years) and Utica Community Schools (8 years) in the Metro Detroit area. He also taught four sections of Computer Science Discoveries (full course) for one year and will be teaching the course again this fall. Even though his background is not in CS, he has learned a lot the past few years and is excited to prove to you that ANYONE can code and to show you how to prove the same to your students!  Michael started his career with a degree in Hospitality Business from Michigan State University (GO Green!!) and worked for Marriott International for several years before going back to school to become a Mathematics teacher and earning a Master of Arts Degree in Teaching from Wayne State University.  Michael has taught and been a facilitator for Code.org in the Computer Science in Algebra curriculum and is now teaching and a Facilitator for Computer Science Discoveries. In his spare time, Michael enjoys most winter sports, flying remote planes and drones, and traveling.

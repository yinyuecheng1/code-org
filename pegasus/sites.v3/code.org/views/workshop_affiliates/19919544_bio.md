My name is Sheila Dartez. I currently live in South Carolina but have lived in 10 different states; life is an adventure!  I have been teaching computer classes for several years and love watching students work through the process of creating programs and solving problems.  The computer has allowed me to teach all students to be creative and learn how to become successful; including deaf and blind students where I taught at the SC School for the Deaf and Blind for three years.  Prior to teaching, I worked as a Computer Operator/Programmer for Computer Science Corp, Harris and RealCom (IBM). In my free time, I travel and spend time at the beach. I look forward to working with all of you.

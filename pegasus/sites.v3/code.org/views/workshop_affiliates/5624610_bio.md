Born and raised in upstate NY, right outside of Albany. Graduated from Siena College in 1993. Played high school and college volleyball as well as semi-pro baseball. I started my teaching career in NYS as a Business Education Teacher. Moved to NC in 1998, where I taught until 2012. Moved to TX in 2014 where I started teaching at my current school, Sharpstown High School. My principal at the time asked me to start a Computer Science Program. That is how I became associated with Code.org. I was so impressed with not only the curricula that they offered, but also with how they support their products and programs. That is what made me want to be a Facilitator with them. In addition to my teaching duties, I have been a coach for almost 30 years, coaching volleyball the whole time at all levels from high school to collegiate, as well as high school baseball and softball. I also officiate Junior Olympic and college volleyball.

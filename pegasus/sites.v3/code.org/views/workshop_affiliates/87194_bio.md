As an English and theatre teacher for 20 years, Amy became known for integrating technology into the curriculum.  As a result, she presented at many local and national conferences, as well as, online Webinars with the Folger Shakespeare Library.  In 2010, Amy used this knowledge along with her experience as a freelance Web designer to certify in Career and Technical Education.  Her initial goal was simply to teach Web design, but she soon discovered the power of computer science for all students.   She looks forward to helping you discover ways to actively engage your students in computational thinking and problem solving while building the 21st century skills necessary for success in any profession.  In 2017, Amy earned National Board Certification.  She was also an AP CSP reader in 2018.  In her spare time, she teaches paper crafting classes in person and online as a Close To My Heart Consultant.  She is a fan of Shakespeare, Harry Potter, and Star Trek (see her IMDb page for more details!).

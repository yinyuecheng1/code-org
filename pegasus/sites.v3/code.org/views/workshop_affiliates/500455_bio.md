Hi all! I am excited to be facilitating with Code.org for the second year. I have just completed my 15th year of teaching in Ohio. I've taught every grade from 1st through 12th in some capacity or another in that time. I spent most of it as a language arts and social social studies teacher. However, the last three years, I've been able to work as a 7th grade computer teacher. I was able to pilot the Code.org's Computer Science Discoveries curriculum which lead me to working as a facilitator for Code. I look forward to continuing to build my CS knowledge.

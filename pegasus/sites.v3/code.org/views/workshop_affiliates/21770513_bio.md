Hey there! How are you doing today? I'm super excited about being a code.org facilitator.  Today's students need and deserve a great computer science education and code.org is on the frontline of those efforts.  I have taught AP Computer Science Principles for two years now with code.org and it is a great course and great experience for both students and teachers. I've been a high school math teacher for 18 years, during that time I've spent at least six of those years teaching some kind of CS or programming.  I live in Lincoln, Nebraska, graduated from the University of Kansas, and earned my masters degree from the University of Nebraska.  I have a lovely and supporting wife and two great sons.  In my spare time I like to spend time outdoors and enjoy time with friends and family. My favorite color is blue and I like to travel.

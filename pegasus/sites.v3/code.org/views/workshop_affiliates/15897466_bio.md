Gin is a passionate advocate for computer science education.  She believes that every student should be exposed to computer science.  Learning how to code is akin to literacy in today's world and computational thinking is a key component.  The problem solving skills learned in computer science class can be applied in all areas of life.  Gin loves to teach students how to become creators, and not just consumers, of technology.  She believes that the “4 c’s” are crucial for success in the 21st century, inside and outside the classroom: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. She has years of experience teaching at both the high school and college level and holds a masters degree in education.

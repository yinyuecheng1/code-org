Colleen began teaching high school 10 years ago after a brief career in environmental policy and poverty alleviation.  She currently teaches computer science, statistics and math at Ipswich High School in Northeast Massachusetts.  She began teaching AP Computer Science Principles the first year it was launched by the College Board and is very enthusiastic about the power of this course to bring new faces to computer science.

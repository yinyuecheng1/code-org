Currently, I work for a Pennsylvania Intermediate Unit that supports local school districts in a variety of capacities.  I particularly support district with needs associated to mathematics or data analysis.  Prior to my work at the Intermediate Unit, I taught middle school and high school mathematics.  The last time I did any significant computer programming was in college so I'm looking forward to see what I remember and excited to share this information with local teachers.

Born in Israel, lived just about everywhere you can imagine, Beth is rarely found in the same place twice.  Currently living in Indianapolis, Beth is a Middle and High school teacher at Indiana School for the Deaf.  She teaches engineering and science courses, with a strong integration of computer science in all classes and at all levels. She believes that all students possess the ability and passion to learn computer science, it just takes the right approach. In her spare time, she rock climbs, dissects whales, builds/maintains bikes, and travels to places that make her family nervous.  Beth  holds degrees in biology, chemistry, engineering, and outdoor/experiential education from various institutions.

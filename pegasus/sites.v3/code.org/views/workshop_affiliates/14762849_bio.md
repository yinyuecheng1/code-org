More than ten years ago I transition to elementary education as a kindergarten teacher followed by two years as a technology resource teacher. Over time my career evolved to include instructional coaching. I supported elementary science teachers as a specialist (four years) and most recently became an Office of School Choice specialist supporting K-12 math, science and STEM schools. I have a passion for teaching, learning and innovation. I enjoy sharing Code.org with my colleagues because it provides the space to collaborate and create opportunities for learning that integrate 21st century learning skills, growth mindset and computational skills.

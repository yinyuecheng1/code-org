Ann Cameron Behar •	Hi, I was born and raised in North Carolina and have never left.  I have a BSBA in Accounting from Appalachian State University (1982). I also have an MBA from Meredith College (1990).  I became a Nationally Board Certified Teacher in 2011. •	I started my career by working as an accountant and financial analyst in the healthcare and retail industries for 15 years before transitioning to corporate and business training.   •	I have worked in public education at the community college, high school and middle school levels for over 20 years.   •	Currently, I teach middle school computer science, technology and business classes in Washington, NC to 6th – 8th graders. I attended TeacherCon in Philadelphia Summer 2017 and have been teaching Computer Science Discoveries ever since.    •	I am married, with 2 adult daughters.  I am lucky enough to live on the river in Washington, NC and enjoy spending time there and at the beach with my family and labradoodle, Minnie.

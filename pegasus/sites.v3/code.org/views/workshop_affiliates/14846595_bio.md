Karen Biege wants to make computer science available in every elementary classroom.  All that educators need is Code.org training, a willingness to participate, and the opportunity to implement Code Studio courses A-F in their classrooms.  Karen has helped to incorporate Code Studio in two K-5 schools  over the past three years and has helped to train the elementary teachers in her district. She has witnessed kidsâ€™ confidence, interest and skill sets in computer science blossom with access to Code.org curriculum.
Karen has been an educator for 22 years and is currently an Innovative Specialist in Janesville, WI. Karen also co-coaches STEM Clubs, First LEGO League and offers numerous professional development sessions to educators in her district. She is committed to providing educational experiences that ensure our students are engaged, empowered and college and career ready. She has fully embraced the concepts, values and benefits of Code.org and thoroughly enjoys offering workshops to other educators.

I'm a business teacher in Polson Montana, right on Flathead lake. Our district is on the Flathead Reservation serving the Salish-Kootenai Tribe. Helping bring CS to Montana has been one of the most rewarding things I have ever done, and I am so optimistic about our states future. I love to do all things outdoors, but I am especially passionate about snowboarding and paddle boarding. Stoked to be at TeacherCon!

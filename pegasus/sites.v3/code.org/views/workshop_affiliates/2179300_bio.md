Rob has been teaching technology to students for almost 25 years now. During that time he has progressed from Apple IIeâ€™s through iMac Blueberries, eMacs, Compaqs, and on towards a class lab full of Dell computers. He has been teaching Computer Science to his 7th and 8th grade students for one year utilizing the Code.Org curriculum after attending TeacherCon in Phoenix in 2017. Rob has been teaching parts of the Hour of Code program to his students for the last 5 years. He believes that all students need to understand the basic concepts of coding, sequential steps, and critical thinking which will help them to interact with technology in their future. This year Rob will be teaching 3 technology classes, and 3 Computer Science classes to his 7th and 8th grade students. Rob has been nominated for teacher of the year in mixed grade levels one time in Yavapai County.

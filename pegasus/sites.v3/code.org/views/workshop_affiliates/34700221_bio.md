Harold has taught a range of courses in his 9 years in education.  His foundation is in math and he moved on to teach economics and social entrepreneurship.  Problem solving has been at the center of everything he teaches so moving into teaching computer science was a natural next step in his teaching career.  Harold is now a founding Computer Science Teacher in KIPP's charter network and will be helping to facilitate computer science teachers joining the KIPP network in coming years.

I am currently the Coordinator of Data and Assessment, Mathematics and Educational Technology for the Cajon Valley Union School District. Previously, I was an Educational Technology Facilitator for the Cajon Valley Union School District, which means I spent my day supporting and coaching teachers on the best practices for technology integration. I also develop and implement the professional development for technology tools. mathematics, and data districtwide. Previously, I was a elementary classroom teacher for 6 years. I am passionate about great teaching that integrates technology to prepare students to be confident and competitive in our global economy.

I love mathematics. I graduated in 2016, with my Masters in K-8 Mathematics from San Diego State University. I have presented at the Greater San Diego Mathematics Conference as well as published an article for Teaching Children Mathematics from National Council of Teaching Mathematics. I am extremely passionate about educational technology, innovation, and equity.

I became a Code.org Facilitator three years ago, and have loved implementing it within my own district as well as sharing it with anyone who attends a workshop. Computer science is a necessary skill of the future and our students must have the opportunity to access this core knowledge.

Scott has been an inner city CS educator for the last twenty years. He is passionate about extending computer science opportunities to students of all ages who happen to live in communities that have been left behind by the technology gold rush.  Scott began his CS education in elementary school by programming TRS-80’s and Commodore computers before graduating to an Apple //e.  His early experience with BBS systems and being connected to the world through a 300 baud modem ignited a passion for computing and technology that burns brightly to this day. Scott has been using code.org’s curricular resources since they first launched on the web, but he became a code.org facilitator two years ago after facilitating several Exploring Computer Science workshops in Indianapolis.  He graduated from Indiana University in Bloomington and completed his Masters coursework there as well.  He still naively believes that technology can change the world for the better.

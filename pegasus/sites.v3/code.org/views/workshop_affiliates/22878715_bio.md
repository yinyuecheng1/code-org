I am entering my third year as a business teacher in Iowa.  At the end of my first year, I was asked by my principal to add a computer science course to my program. I was very apprehensive as I was previously an Language Arts teacher and had difficulty with math and science. However, I went ahead and added the class. The first year was a great learning experience and I will be adding another computer science class to my curriculum in my third year.  I know that if I can teach computer science, anyone can.

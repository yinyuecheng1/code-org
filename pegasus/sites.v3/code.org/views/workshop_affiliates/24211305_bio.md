Janice has taught Computer Science at the middle school level for the last 13 years.  She taught in the first county in Virginia to have Computer Science/Programming classes at all middle schools and she was instrumental in building the program to that level within the county.  Janice began working with CodeVA in 2013 and Code.org in 2014 as a K5 facilitator.  Over the next 3.5 years, Janice traveled throughout Virginia training K5 teachers how to integrate computer science in their regular curriculum.  In 2017, Janice became a part of the Standards of Learning Computer Science Steering Committee at the state level in Virginia writing the Standards of Learning for Computer Science.  That same year, she became a certified CS Discoveries facilitator with both Code.org and CodeVA.  In 2018, she worked with a small group of educators in Virginia to write the curriculum for the Computer Science Elective Standards of Learning.  In the summer of 2018, Janice relocated to Central Texas.  Janice has 3 children who live in Virginia, Tennessee, and Texas and have all served in the military.  In her free time, Janice loves to read, garden, travel, and spend time with her family and grand-puppies.

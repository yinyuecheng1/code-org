From naval aviator to design engineer to technology coordinator/instructor, Rubin has been involved in technology for a number of years. He is currently the Technology Coordinator for Dorothy and Noble Harrelson School a Title I K – 8 school in Puryear, (West) TN.  Over time he has work with Harrelson’s technology curriculum to move away from computer apps and keyboarding. In 2010 he added Scratch to the curriculum for grades 6 – 8 and in early 2014 added CODE.org’s Computer Principals for grades 2 – 5. He continues, with an extremely supportive admin, to add additional offerings for his students. These currently include LEGO Boost Robotics for 3 – 5, CODE.org CS Discoveries, Robotics using the Arduino as the controller and Mobile App Development for 6 – 8. His goal started out and remains: To help the students understand that regardless of their gender, culture, economic class or any other group they are included in within our community… technology is not just the appliance (computer, Chromebook, tablet, or phone) that they are currently using but how can we improve what we are doing with those appliances and they can participate in this process as computational thinkers and problem solvers.

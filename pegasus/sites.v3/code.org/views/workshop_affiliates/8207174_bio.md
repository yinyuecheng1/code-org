I have used Code.Org resources for the past five years to teach coding  to over 500 elementary students in grades 1-4 at Muldown Elementary in Whitefish Montana.   Muldown was fortunate to be selected as the Montana recipient of a grant from Code.org that allowed for the purchase of technology that allowed me to enhance the coding instruction.  Two years ago I was selected to  teach every sixth grader at Whitefish Middle School coding as well as teach an advanced coding class for seventh and eighth graders.  This year I've continued teaching all students grade 1-4 Technology and two classes of coding for grades 7 and 8.

I have taught computer science for 12 years. In that time, I have gone from being the only computer science teacher in a district to being one of several computer science teachers at my school. I currently teach Computer Science Principles, adjunct teach CSP at the university level, AP Computer Science A, Cyber Security, and our school’s CS/Engineering Capstone course. Having taught CS and project based classes, I cannot imagine teaching where students didn’t have total choice in their projects based on their interests. Beyond teaching, I am a father of two and an urbanist nerd. I am on the board of a local transit advocacy group called ModeShift Omaha. I like board games, YouTube rabbit holes, and shouting about parking policy. I am so excited to be a Code.org facilitator. I have taught many varieties for introductory computer science courses and have found the most robust curriculum in the Code.org offering. Computer Science has the potential to be one of the most impactful courses a student takes in their high school carrier and I can’t wait to help spread this in my community!

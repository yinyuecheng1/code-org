My name is Matt Kershaw and I am beginning my 20th year of teaching math at El Cajon Valley High.  I have a BA in Mathematics from San Diego State University, my MA in Teaching with a specialization in Education Technology from National University, and then went on to become a National Board Certified Teacher.  Last year was my first year teaching AP Computer Science Principles and I am extremely excited about my second year.  My first year only had 14 students.  This coming year I have two sections with over 60 total students.  I had one programing class in college over 20 years ago, so I was very nervous about teaching a Computer Science class.  Code.org has made this curriculum accessible to everyone, including teachers without a background in Computer Science.  I hope that you are excited about this opportunity and I look forward to helping you in any way that I can.

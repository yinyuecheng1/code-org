Doug grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and moved to the Las Vegas area in 1999. He received his bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Cleveland State University in 1999, and his master’s degree in curriculum and instruction from University of Nevada-Las Vegas in 2001. Doug has taught middle school math, science, and has now been teaching computer literacy and computer science for the past four years.  During the 2017-2018 school year, Doug taught all 6 units of the CS Discoveries course to a class of 8th grade students.  His constant self-evaluation, continued personal learning, school and community involvement provide him with the tools necessary to maximize his students’ potential. He makes it a point to continue to learn formally and informally as often as possible. His practice is adjusted based on the observation and knowledge of his students' interests, abilities, skills, and circumstances. Doug is a candidate for National Board Certification and is waiting for his final scores to be released in December 2018. In his free time, Doug enjoys traveling with his wife and two children. He also enjoys hiking and cooking.

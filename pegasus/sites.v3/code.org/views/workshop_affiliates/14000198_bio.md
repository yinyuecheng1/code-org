I was born in Cincinnati, Ohio where I attended the Schoolf for Creative and Performing Arts. I graduated with my B.S. in life science and chemistry from Otterbein College. I've been teaching science in Palm Coast, Florida for past 14 years. I currently teach AP Biology and have just completed my 2nd year teaching AP Computer Science Principles. I attended my first TeacherCon in Salt Lake City 2 summers ago and have loved teaching computer science ever since. My husband and I have three daughters with whom we love to travel.

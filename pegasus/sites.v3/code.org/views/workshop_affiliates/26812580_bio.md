Amy is currently a 6th grade PLTW teacher. Led by her passion for project-based learning, Amy hosts weekly coding and STEM clubs as well participates in a fun group called, “STEM Billings” to bring these opportunities to more students in her local community and state. Formerly an elementary teacher with the unique opportunity to have taught all grades 1-6, she led a 6-time undefeated elementary math team in addition to before and after school robotics and STEM clubs where she had the privilege to see the love of learning ignite in many children. She believes that in addition to bringing computer science to all kids that every child should have an opportunity to be involved with a local Maker Space to solve real-world problems.

My name is Kelly Moehn. I am married to my husband John. Together we have four children; Maggie (11), Abby(10), Virginia (9), and Charlie (8). I teach Business Education and Computer Science at Chilton Public Schools Grades 7-12. I am about to start my 10th year of teaching. (I did take 7 years off to have and raise kids). I currently am working on earning my Computer Science licensure. Over the last three to four years I have emersed myself in learning about Computer Science. I have participated in the (2) year Exploring Computer Science training, taken the Methods of teaching CS through LaCrosse, selected to attend TeacherCon in Philadelphia to learn Code.org’s curriculum for AP CS Principles and attended the quarterly sessions, and I am currently training to be a facilitator for Code.org’s CS Discoveries course. My time is split between the Middle & High School. Next school year I will be teachingthe following CS courses; 7th grade Units 1-2 of CS Discoveries, 8th grade Units 3-4 of CS Discoveries, ECS, and IT Academy (a course where students decide to learn more about Networking computers or select a programming language to learn. I also teach students to become proficient in Microsoft Office. In addition, I am the adviser to the school store and FBLA and in the spring I am privileged to coach the CHS Varsity Golf Team. When I have free time, I nap ;) . .

I started teaching in 2009 with AP Calculus. Eventually due to the need I started teaching computer science. Currently I teach at a small private school in Alabama that serves 5th through 12th grade students where we offer classes from CS Fundamentals through AP CSP and AP CSA, with additional classes on Python, web design, and 3D printing. I'm married with 2 kids, age 7 and 3. When I'm not teaching I'm usually running on local trails.

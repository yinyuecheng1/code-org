I have taught Computer Science at Spotswood High School in Spotswood, NJ since 2003.  I am the former president of the Central NJ Computer Science Teachers' Association (CSTA) and was one of twelve teachers selected to represent the United States at the first annual Microsoft Innovative Teachers Worldwide Forum.  I am currently the co-adviser of the Spotswood High School Hackspace Club, which allows students to explore their interests in technology, programming, and electronics.

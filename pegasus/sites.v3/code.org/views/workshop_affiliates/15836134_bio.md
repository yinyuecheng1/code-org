Rachel teaches in the Utica Community School district in Sterling Heights, Michigan where she has taught mathematics for 13 years and has taught Computer Science Discoveries for 1 year. Teaching Computer Science Discoveries helped her grow as an educator and she learned so much teaching the course and is excited to help you do the same.  Rachel believes computer science is crucial to teach in todayâ€™s classroom and wants to support you as you bring computational thinking and computer science into your classroom. She also looks forward to supporting you in your role of lead learner as you learn from other Computer Science Discoveries teachers as well as learning from your students. Rachel holds a BA in mathematics and a MA in curriculum and teaching, both from Michigan State University. In her free time, Rachel is an avid traveler (and believes the world is a classroom) and enjoys rooting on the Michigan State Spartans and all of  the Detroit sports teams.

Yolanda started teaching Math and Computer Science before she became an official teacher. She taught technology based courses both as a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon and as an undergraduate at The University of Michigan.  After retiring from a string High Tech startups, she began teaching programming as a volunteering at her sonâ€™s elementary school. Eventually it became apparent that this was not only fun, but that there was a real need for CS teachers in the school systems.  Thus began the crusade to teach programming and aid teachers in their ability to further their comfort with technology! She currently teaches APCS  and volunteers in whatever capacity needed to spread the support and knowledge to teachers, administrators and students interested in Computer Science.  In her spare time she rides motorcycles, helps coach little league, teaches Spanish, makes quilts, pretends to train for triathlons and tries to keep up with her kids. She is always looking for the next challenge!

I have been a business and technology teacher for 3 years at Climax-Scotts Jr./Sr. High School.  Prior to switching careers to be a teacher I was a corporate trainer and Senior Adjuster at Farmers Insurance for most of a decade.  I have a BS in Management and an MBA from Cornerstone University as well as a Masterâ€™s degree in Career and Technical Education from Western Michigan University.  My dream career is teaching. I strive to empower others to be sure that they are not only successful, but feel the pride that goes along with success.  Empowering that confidence is crucial for students to be self-motivated in their learning.   In my spare time I spend as much time with my family as possible.  I am married to my high school sweetheart and we have 4 amazing children.  We travel to sporting events for the kids, go camping, and spend time at our family cabin in Ludington, MI.

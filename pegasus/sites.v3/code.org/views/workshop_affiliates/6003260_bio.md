Angela is an excited full time Computer Science teacher at George Washington High School. Prior to teaching Computer Science (CS), Angela taught English for 15 years. During her first year of teaching CS, Angela’s students won the Indiana Samsung Solve for Tomorrow contest in 2016 by creating a web page and inventory control system for their school’s food pantry. The amazing part of the story is Angela’s students came into their CS course without any knowledge of computer science. Since Angela’s inaugural year of computer science, her students have created a reading comprehension game for an elementary school and provided technology services to their community.  Angela is excited to see the wonderful accomplishments that await her students this upcoming school year.

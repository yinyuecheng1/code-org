First grade teacher, fourth grade teacher, computer specialist, assistant principal, gifted specialist, and learning strategist. Throughout all those roles I've held during my career in education, finding ways to connect students with computer science has always been a passion. I was one of the early users of code.org's courses with my elementary students and have been a promoter of the Hour of Code for several years. With the introduction of computer science standards in Nevada, I'm excited about working to move forward the push to help all students connect with this exciting field not only for career possibilities but also for the creative and critical thinking, logic, and problem solving skills it will help them build that will serve them well in all areas of life.

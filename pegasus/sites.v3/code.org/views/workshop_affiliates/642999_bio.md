I am a seven year veteran of the United States Air Force. When I left the Air Force, I had several job titles. I was a Salesman, Garage Door Installer, Bookkeeper, Project Manager, Operations Manager, Level Three Electronics Engineer, and a Production Supervisor. I started teaching in 2008. I have settled as a multiple certification high school teacher and am currently a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Applications) Instructor and teaching a pilot program, Exploring Computer Science. I am also a contractor for the Mississippi State University Research Curriculum Unit for STEM Methods. I've been married to the love of my life since 1999, my reason to be alive came in 2010 in the form of a little boy, and my second reason joined us in 2014. My passions are teaching, technology, designing, inventing, and creative arts.

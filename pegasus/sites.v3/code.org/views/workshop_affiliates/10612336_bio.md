My name is Jessica Fernandez, and I am an apprentice facilitator in training. I am currently a technology teacher in Atlantic Beach, FL (Duval county) for 6th-8th grade. I teach a combination of computer applications and computer sciences classes of about 45 students (yes, in each of my classes!). I recently completed a Master's degree in Instructional Technology and truly enjoy training teachers in my district on the many ways technology can enhance pedagogy. In my spare time, I tutor after school for a program called Communities in Schools for disadvantaged youth, travel whenever possible, and spend time with my husband and 6 year old son. I look forward to this new adventure and to learning alongside you all.

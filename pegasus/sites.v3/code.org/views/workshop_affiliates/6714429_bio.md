I've been teaching at the elementary level for over 13 years.  My current role is STEAM Specialist at a diverse K-5 STEAM magnet school in Groton, CT.   I teach robotics, MakerLab, and computer science to students in grades 1-5.  In addition I collaborate with teachers on special projects and provide coaching and professional development in STEAM related topics.  Outside of school, I spend a lot of time outdoors, running, biking, paddling, skiing, and hiking.  Providing students with equitable unique learning experiences is a passion of mine.

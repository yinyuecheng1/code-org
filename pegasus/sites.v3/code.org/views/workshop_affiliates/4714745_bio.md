Madeline is a computer science/engineering teacher and digital learning specialist in Minneapolis, MN. In addition to this, she was a curriculum developer with Code.org, most specifically helping to design the AP Computer Science & Programming curriculum and has been facilitating CSP professional development sessions for the past 5 years.   Madeline earned a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.F.A. in Fine Arts from Cornell University, and an M.S.Ed. in Educational Studies with a specialization in Technology Integration from Johns Hopkins University. She was invited to the White House as one of the NSF's 100 "Superstar" teachers in 2015, and invited to tea with the Secretary of Education in 2016.  Madeline often finds herself standing at the intersection between art, math, and technology and is motivated by the opportunity to pull others in to this space, looking at each of these subjects from a non-traditional viewpoint.  She loves teaching CSP because it breaks the mold of traditional computer science courses as coding classes, and creates a classroom experience where creativity and mistakes are celebrated and students are able to shape their dreams.

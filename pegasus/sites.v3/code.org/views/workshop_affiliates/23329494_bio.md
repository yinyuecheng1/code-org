I am a mother of 3 and dedicated wife who began my teaching career about 4 years ago as a career changer. I began in the business field and then moved into the growing field of computer science. I was one of first group of teachers to pilot the CS Discoveries curriculum and have been using it ever since. I began in middle school and have moved to high school where I currently teach for Charleston County School District.

I have been teaching Interactive Digital Media at the Cranston Area Career & Technical Center since 1999. This three year program includes topics such as web design, game design and development and animation. I am always pushing my students to be creative, problem solve and work as a team. I love to watch their faces when they see their hard work pay off after I have guided them a little to figure something out or make improvements on a project. For the last three years I have been teaching the AP Computer Science Principles as well. This is a great opportunity to have my students work on their problem solving and team building skills. I earned my bachelor’s degree from Fitchburg State College in Career & Technical Education. My master’s degree in Special Education is from Bridgewater State College. Previous to teaching, I spent several years working in industry as a Technical Associate for a computer magazine. I gained invaluable knowledge about working as a team, being creative and meeting deadlines. In my spare time I enjoy some outdoor activities like paddle board, swimming and adventure parks. I love to read non-fiction books about history, visit new places and spend time with my family.

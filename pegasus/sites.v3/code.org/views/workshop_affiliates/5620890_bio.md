From the time he created “Rude Robby’s Pizza Parlor” in Basic on a TRS-80, Mike Conklin knew that computer science was the perfect outlet for someone that liked to express himself both creatively and analytically. Mike has just finished his 22nd year in the classroom. All 22 of those years include teaching math at a variety of levels, with the last three seeing a lean towards computer science. He holds a B.S.Ed from the University of Idaho (major: math, minor: art) and an M.A. from the University of Maryland (curriculum and instruction). Mike has enjoyed teaching Computer Science Principles over the last three years and added CS Discoveries to the mix this year. To say he appreciates seeing his students give life to their ideas would be an understatement. In his spare time, Mike likes to play guitar, travel with his family, and create things, both digital and ‘analog’.

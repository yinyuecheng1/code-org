Lisa has been an elementary teacher for more than 20 years.  She has taught students in grades 3rd-8th and is now the Media Specialist/computer teacher at her school in Jacksonville, Florida.  Presently, she teaches multimedia, Modern Tech, and Computer Science Discoveries classes to middle school students.  A few years back, Lisa was introduced to "Hour of Code" at a conference and saw a need for the younger generation to learn about computer science because wherever you look, computers are everywhere.  Lisa earned her teaching degree at Bowling Green State University (Ohio), then continued to get endorsements in gifted education and Library/Media.

In addition to being a facilitator for Code.org, Erica is also a project specialist for the Muskegon Area Intermediate School District since 2012.  She currently works with local school districts on various science programs and place-based education projects.  She also taught high school biology and chemistry for 10 years at a local school in Muskegon County.  She firmly believes that STEM programs, including computer science are critical and a necessary part of an educational foundation for all K-12 students.  In her spare time, she enjoys pretty much any outdoor activity, especially mountain biking, hiking with her dogs, and paddle boarding.

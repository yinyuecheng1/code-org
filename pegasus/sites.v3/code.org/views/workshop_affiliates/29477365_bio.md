Malati began teaching math and science 13 years ago in North Carolina.  She moved to West Virginia 7 years ago and is currently the library/media specialist at a middle school in Southern West Virginia.  She holds a B.S. in Education from Concord University and a M.A. in Secondary Education from Marshall University.  She is also a certified Technology Integration Specialist.  Malati has worked closely with other teachers in the building to promote the school’s STEAM initiative.  She’s excited to promote and teach computer science.  This year is an exciting change for students in her building and she hopes to build excitement and support for your computer science courses too!  In her spare time, Malati enjoys tackling home improvement projects and gardening.

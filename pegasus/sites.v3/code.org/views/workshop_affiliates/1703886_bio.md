I am a K-5 Computer Science Teacher at Meadow Lane Elementary School in Lincoln, Nebraska.  Iâ€™m PASSIONATE about students and teachers using TECHNOLOGY for LEARNING and CREATIVITY. I work daily with elementary students, teachers, and administrators to facilitate technology learning.  I was honored to serve on the Nebraska Educational Technology Association board for 6 years.  I've presented numerous times at the NETA conference, FETC, and for district staff.

Catherine has a B.S. in Geology living in South Florida where there are no earthquakes, volcanoes or even a hill.  Since geology was not a career option she pursued her next passion: computers.  She moved to Haiti for five years where she taught science and established the first computer lab in the country.  After moving to Miami she worked for 15 years as the Director of Education for a major computer dealer supporting both Apple and PC computers for teachers, school districts and state DOEs.  However, she missed her students so went back into the classroom teaching science and a variety of computer classes including programming and Cisco Networking Academy.  For the last 30 years she has been actively training teachers and administrators in using computers to improve education. She is a strong advocate for increasing diversity in technology.  Catherine holds a M.S. degree in Computer Applications.

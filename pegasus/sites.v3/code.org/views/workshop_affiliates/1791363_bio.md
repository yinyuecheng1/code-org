Joel has primarily been a high school math teacher throughout his teaching career. His assignments have ranged from Algebra I to Calculus II. Beginning in 1995, he assumed the responsibility of a computer programming course. That course evolved from TrueBASIC, to C++, to HTML with PHP. Recently he joined in the CSP movement, first with PLTW and then with PLTW. One of his passions is database work. He started with a program to manage a weight-lifting for athletes. For a period of about eight years he managed a 4-D database that housed all district curriculum, standards, and assessments. His other activities include coaching football and track & field. Life in Northwest Iowa primarily centers around his family of six kids and the acreage they are attempting to tame.

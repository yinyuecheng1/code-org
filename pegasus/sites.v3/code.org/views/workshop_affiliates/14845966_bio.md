Marianne is the Library Information Specialist at Edmonds Heights K12 which is an alternative school for families who choose to homeschool their children. Previously she coordinated libraries and instructional technology for Edmonds school district, was an elementary Teacher Librarian, and  classroom teacher.  She became a Code.org Fundamentals Facilitator in 2016 because she passionately believes every child should learn CS beginning in Kindergarten. She has led workshops for over 400 teachers in CSF.  Every elementary teacher in her school district has been exposed to CSF curriculum and most attended a CSF workshop.  The Code.org CSF curriculum has been adopted as a science unit in elementary schools for the 2018-19 school year.  Marianne is grateful to be in a school district which recognizes the need for CS for all and the importance of having strong library information and technology programs in every school.  She is currently serving as the Chairperson for the Washington Library Association School Library Division.

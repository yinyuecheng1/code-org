I have been teaching high school technology and various other subjects for 20+ years (this is my 24th year at Clinton High School in Lenawee County) For the past 4 years I have had an advanced CSP class and now this will be my 2nd year teaching AP CSP with the Code.org curriculum. I am passionate about the CSP being a class for everyone, teachers and administors included. We are all coders, some just donâ€™t know it, Yet!  I am the mentor teacher for our local SADD  and SPLT chapter. Be looking for one of our bills at the state level (we hope). In my spare time I enjoy being outside and unplugged with boating, hiking, camping and scuba. I also enjoy traveling, meeting new people and exploring new places.

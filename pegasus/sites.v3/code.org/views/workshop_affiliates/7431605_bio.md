Leif (“Layf”) earned an EdM in physics education at Rutgers University. In 2008, he started teaching science and engineering to middle and high school students. He has a learner-centered approach, prioritizing project/problem-based learning focused on the community outside of school. He has experience with standards-based progress reporting.

In 2015, Leif put his coding hobby to work teaching computer science - including CS Discoveries and CS Principles. As a side hustle, he also started developing web apps.

Recently, Leif has been focusing his time outside school on building up the “Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program” in his neighborhood in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

I have been a dedicated STEAM teacher for the past 13 years within the LAUSD, and I have been a working musician within film, web series, studio, on stage, and on cruise ships for the past 23 years. As a music composer and special f/x artist within the Los Angeles entertainment industry, I have collaborated on various short film and feature film projects, which can be found on Amazon Prime. I am a part of the Teachers in Space organization, was selected as an attendee of the Honeywell Educator’s program (Teacher Space Academy and Green Boot Camp), an affiliate of the LA Allstar Program, and Pals Around the World, in which I have performed original science-based rock’n’roll music shows around the city. Currently, I am developing virtual reality and augmented reality apps for therapeutic and educational purposes. You may view project portfolio at https://jamesemley.com. My interest in Computer Science is applying 3D Design, User Experience, and VR Design aspects as a core fundamental of CS in the classroom.

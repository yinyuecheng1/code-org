In addition to being a facilitator for Code.org Melissa Zeitz started her teaching career specializing in Special Education and most recently Instructional Technology for K through 5 grade.   She believes strongly in teaching all of her students to persevere and to become creators of technology rather than  consumers. She believes strongly in educating her students on how to persevere, collaborate with peers, and problem solve through the use of Computer Science and digital learning projects. Her hope is to share with teachers everywhere, the importance of integrating Computer Science into their curriculum.

Jayne Leusink is a firm believer that every student, everywhere, should be given the opportunity to discover the benefits of computer science. She has been advocating for computer science ever since graduating from Dakota State University in Madison, SD with a degree in Business Education. It was during her first computer programming class at DSU that she really saw the importance of computational thinking and problem solving. Becoming a teacher of technology/media has allowed her to grow professionally and promote computer science and foundational learning. While at Custer School District, she began a 3D printing program, launched a tech curriculum using many different platforms, and received a district award called the Golden Apple recognizing her innovative efforts in the classroom. She has loved code.org and their vision ever since their beginning. Her first professional development opportunity with code.org in 2014 was in Denver, CO. She is beyond excited to be in the role as a facilitator. She has a passion for leading others, while remaining a lifelong learner herself. Jayne Leusink resides in the Black Hills and is currently the head librarian at Central High School in Rapid City.

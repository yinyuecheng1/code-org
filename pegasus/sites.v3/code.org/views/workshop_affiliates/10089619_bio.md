My name is Glen Boles and I teach technology at Wellington Elementary in Lexington, KY.  I have loved coding since I wrote my first program on an Apple following pages of code in a Byte magazine.  I started teaching in 2001 and then developed e-learning for our Department of Juvenile Justice when I moved to another city.  I developed e-learning for 12 years before I went back into teaching. During that time I discovered Scratch and became an advocate for coding in the classroom. I worked with the state's Department of Juvenile Justice to help bring technology to those students adjudicated to us.  When I returned to the classroom, I discovered Code.org's curriculum and their Hour of Code.  I have been using Code.org and Scratch continuously in my classroom for the past 3 years.  I love Code.org's curriculum!

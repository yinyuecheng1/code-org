Michael Deslauriers graduated from Rhode Island College in 1996 with a BA in Secondary Education Mathematics.  He received his Master’s in Arts in Teaching Mathematics from Providence College in 2000. Michael saw the need for students to learn Computer Science earlier than most people so he started an AP Computer Science A course at Smithfield High School in September 2010.  After a couple of years of all boy classes, he started an Exploring Computer Science Semester Course to get female students interested in this field.  In the fall of 2016 he started teaching an AP Computer Science Principles Course to get even more students interested.  Michael also helped create the CSTA Rhode Island Chapter and is currently the Vice President.  He runs several after school clubs such as Technovation and an App Inventor Club.  His team of students made it to “Best in State” for the Verizon App Challenge for three consecutive years and the “Best in Region” during the second year.  In his free time, he enjoys spending time with his wife and 2 children.  He enjoys fishing, sailing, volleyball, biking, hiking and golf.

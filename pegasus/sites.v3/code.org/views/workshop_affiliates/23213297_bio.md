Ken has been teaching science and math for 7 years in Boston and Maine. Currently, he teaches Earth Systems Science and AP Computer Science at Old Town High School in Old Town, Maine.  Although he never studied computer science formally as a student, he has always been interested in it and getting the opportunity to teach it has helped him discover a passion he didn’t know he had.  He has used many online resources, including the ones he uses with his students, to teach himself as much as he can about computer science and coding. In addition, he is excited about helping with the work of spreading computer science education at Old Town High School, across the state of Maine, and nationally.  To Ken, all of this work feels like it is just getting started and he can’t wait to see where it goes. Ken holds a M.S. in Teaching from the University of Maine.  In his free time, Ken trains for and competes in road races from 5ks to marathons, watches his hometown team, the Golden State Warriors, win championships, and builds endless toy train tracks with his two year old son.

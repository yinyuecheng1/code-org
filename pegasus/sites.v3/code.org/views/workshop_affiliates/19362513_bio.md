Valerie is new to computer science, but not coding.  She has been teaching English/Literacy 6-12 for over 12 years and has been a Literacy Coach for several of those years. The last five years have seen her spearheading the Hour of Code initiative for her school and colleagues.  She is all about education, literacy and computer science and believes that computer science and coding can improve student comprehension in other academic areas. She recently participated in a NSF-TERC.edu sponsored research grant researching the effects of gaming on improving academics. Valerie holds a Master’s and Specialist degrees in Education – Social Foundations and Education Leadership from Florida Atlantic University and is currently teaching CS Discoveries - middle school grades 6-8 at Glades Middle School in Miramar, Florida.  In her spare time, she enjoys a good game of golf and sports a 27 handicap when she plays and is passionate about coding.  This year she hopes to start a “Girls Who Code” club to empower and encourage girls into coding and engineering fields.

Alisha is an 8th grade teacher at Warren Central Junior High in the Vicksburg Warren School District. She has been with the district for almost 10 years. Throughout her teaching career, she has taught Career Discovery, ICTI, ICTII, and currently teaches Keystone and Design and Modeling. Alisha loves Computer Science and STEM courses. She took a huge interest in it as an adult and makes an effort to introduce her students to it as much as possible. Alisha believes that Computer Science is just as important as the other major subjects should be a required course. Sheâ€™s also given presentations on ways to implement Computer Science into any class. When she is not learning of new things to teach her students and other adults, she enjoys spending time with her sons and attending the many sports events her husband coaches.

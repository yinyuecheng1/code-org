Amy is excited to be part of the code.org team as her introduction to computer science was through code.org. She believes that all learners should have  experiences with computer science and computational thinking strategies. She is grateful to have the opportunity to share the code.org curriculum with others. Amy is an educator in York, PA where she supports teachers as they infuse technology and develop STEM thinking processes (including CS) with their learners.

Dr. Crabtree has been a Career and technology teacher for over 10 years. She teaches Computer Science, Fundamentals and Advanced Web Page Design, Desktop Publishing and Image Editing classes. She has settled on very comprehensive subjects and feels that Computer Science can also serve as the bridge between disciplines. Dr. Crabtree wants to share her passion for technology, art, media and design with students and show them the potential that these subjects have to communicate ideas on both a large and small scale. Her goal is to inspire students to seek out their own passions, learn to communicate in a variety of ways in an ever-growing society and encourage personal growth through goal setting. She obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Management from Morris College in Sumter, SC and acquired courses for Education certification from The Citadel in Charleston, SC, and received her Doctoral degree in Education (Organizational Leadership and Human Resources) from Nova Southeastern University, Fort Lauderdale, FL. In addition to teaching, Dr. Crabtree serves as a Professional Learning Communities Facilitator for her colleagues. In her spare time, she enjoys spending time with family, reading and analyzing different genres of digital media.

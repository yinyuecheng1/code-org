My name is Jessica Green and I have been teaching for ten years. I have actively been using code.org as part of my curriculum for the past five years in my classroom. I have taught an average about 400 students (ranging from 2nd-8th grade) how to use code.org in my years of using this amazing program. Teaching students how to code is a passion of mine because computer science is actively changing everything. Not only does code.org teach students the basics of coding, it teaches students how to problem solve, persevere when material becomes difficult, and apply the knowledge in different ways. I believe every student should have access to computer science knowledge at a very young age to help prepare them for the ever changing world in which we live. In my spare time, I love to cook healthy meals for my daughter and I, hiking, being outside, as well as working out.

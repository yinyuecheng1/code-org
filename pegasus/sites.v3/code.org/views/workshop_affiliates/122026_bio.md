James Cunningham brings a wide range of skills to the table as a Code.org facilitator.  James grew up on the Wind River Indian Reservation and continues to teach there to this day.  James has 15 year of experience teaching and is certified in Elementary Ed, Middle school Generalist, Industrial Arts K-12, and At Risk.  He also has a masters in Special Education and is a Certified Orientation Mobility Specialist (teaches the white cane to low vision individuals).  Although James does not have a degree in computer science he has found his passion in teaching it.  James started teaching computer science five years ago while teaching graphic arts.  He decided students needed to know more about the programs and computers they were using to better understand the art his students were creating.  In his spare time James like hiking, camping and exploring Wyomingâ€™s wonderful open spaces.

Following a BS in Business Management from Brigham Young University and an early career in Colorado as a manufacturing manager, David returned to his hometown community in Summit County, Utah to answer the call for a high school technology teacher. From 1997 to 2011, he taught computer and technology classes both in secondary school and as an evening adjunct at Utah Valley University. In 2011, David returned to the manufacturing field, where he came to lead a team working on high-voltage, clean energy solutions for the international community. In 2015, he responded to the increasing need for secondary school computer science teachers and has been teaching coding ever since. David began working with code.org in the Summer of 2016, and has been facilitating Computer Science Discoveries workshops for the past year.

Julie is entering her 21st year in education.  After teaching 12 years in a technology enriched math/reading/ELA classroom, she started working with teachers and students as the technology integration specialist for grades 6-12 in the Effingham Unit 40 School District.  Julie holds a BS in Elementary Education with Middle School endorsements in math, reading, language arts, and computers, a PreK-12 Library Media Specialist endorsement, and a MS Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction, Instructional Technology.  In addition to working with students and teachers in the classroom, Julie has worked outside the classroom to develop extra curricular and summer programs designed to encourage all students to explore computer science.  She is passionate about giving all students the opportunity to delve into computer science by providing teachers with the tools and resources to be lead learners.  Julie is always up for a new book, a fun diy project, or an adventure with her children and husband.

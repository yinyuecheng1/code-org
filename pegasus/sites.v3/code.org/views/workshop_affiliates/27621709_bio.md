Tori is an Instructional Specialist at the Institute for School Partnership at Washington University St. Louis. She joined the team after spending several years integrating computer science into her science classroom. Inspired by the challenge to reverse engineer a glucometer using open source hardware during a Research Experience for Teachers at the University of Illinois, she pushed to bring CS experiences to students in her school. In her classroom, students discovered how to create circuits and program an arduino to control the circuit. Students were also given time to research and begin to learn a programming language of their choice. Tori earned her Masterâ€™s in Education from the University of Illinois, focusing on Learning Design and Leadership with the emphasis of Technology Integration. Spending the past couple years assisting teachers with curriculum implementation and technology integration, she is excited to continue to support teachers as they use Code.org materials with their students.

I have been in education for 14 years. I have taught elementary and middle school and am currently the Director of Educational Technology and the ELD Coordinator for a charter school in Parker, CO. I teach middle school technology electives and also work with grades k-8 for language development. I am the mother of two awesome sons who are 15 and 22. When I have spare time, I like to sew and quilt.

Adam is a public-school teacher in Western New York. Graduate of Buffalo State College with a BS (1993) and MS (1998) in Mathematics Teaching, Adam has spent hundreds of hours in programming courses focused on teaching mathematics and coding. The last few years he has been teaching CS courses full time including Alice 2.4, C++, and APCS-A. APCS-P is a fantastic fit for Adam because his teaching style is student focused and class-oriented. He serves as a facilitator responsive to student needs yet driving the class toward the curricular goals intended. Soft skills like communication, collaboration, cooperation, and situational understanding are as, or more, important than coding in Mr. Z's class. All students are welcome and all students can learn success in Adam's CS classes. Students can build on those successful experiences and take their skills anywhere. He'll be glad to help and teach you how to be an accomplished educator in the 21st century.

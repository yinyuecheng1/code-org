I've been teaching AP Computer Science Principles since its introduction as a pilot in the state of Alabama. I currently teach Programming I, AP CSP and AP CSA at Tuscaloosa County High School. I serve as an AP Reader, AP Mentor and Code.org trainer. I also teach a computer science Institute at the University of Alabama for College Board and conduct Saturday Study Sessions for the AP CSP Exam for A+ College Ready. I am married to my wonderful wife, Amanda and we have 1 daughter, 7 and two sons, 5 and 7 months.

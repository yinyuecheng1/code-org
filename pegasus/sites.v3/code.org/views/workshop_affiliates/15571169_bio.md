Raj Gupta is a father of three kind and funny children. He is the coach to two terrific high school teams. And he is a grateful mentor to the many students he has the privilege of serving at Windham High School (Windham, NH). Raj recently came to teaching after working for many fun, dynamic companies like Google, and Amazon. Although his background with those companies was not in computing, Raj made the switch to teaching to increase the access of CS for all students, with a special focus on his classes reflecting the diversity of his school. Windham HS currently has about 250 students (out of a student body of 900) taking CS as an elective. When not with his kids, or coaching athletes, Raj can be found playing hockey, or CrossFitting.

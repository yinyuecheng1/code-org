Jonathan Perrone is a middle school STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) teacher from Phoenix, AZ. For the past 11 years Jonathan has been leading his students on a journey to discover the wondrous principles and practices in the many fields of science and STEAM. In the last three years Jonathan has taken on the principle role of developing a full two-year STEAM program at Mountain Sky Middle School, a Title 1 public school in North Phoenix. This program now offers students the opportunity to engage with topics such as computer science, engineering solutions to real world problems, Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and 3D Printing, robotics, drones, electronics and much more. Last year more than half of the total students at Mountain Sky participated in the STEAM program.



Mr. Perrone is a dedicated educator and a committed father to his two young daughters, Seraphina (four), and Gianna (who will be two in October). He is married to his wonderful wife Veronica, who is also an educator and professional development provider for early childhood teachers. Jonathan hopes to continue his path in education as he tries to bring more innovation and creativity into classrooms at the state and national level.

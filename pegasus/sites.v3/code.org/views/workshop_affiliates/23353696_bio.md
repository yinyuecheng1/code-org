Erinâ€™s interest in computer programming began while rock climbing at the Red Rock National Conservation Area. This is where she discovered that her friend, a computer programmer, wanted to volunteer to teach kids how to code. They decided to work together, and throughout the next few years they hosted coding clubs at the schools where Erin was teaching. While assisting with the coding clubs, Erin began to realize the creative and crafty nature of coding as she watched students program games, stories, and speed art. This inspired her to return to college to take her first programming classes. The classes were challenging and helped her realize the importance of ensuring that students have opportunities to learn programming skills at the primary and secondary school levels. She continues teaching students computer programming and learning with them along the way.

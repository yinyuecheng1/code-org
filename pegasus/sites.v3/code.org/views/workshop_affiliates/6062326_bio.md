Herman Nelson is an instructional technology coach in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. He teaches K-6 after-school computer classes,  has a M.S. degree in Computer Information Systems and co-owns an  Unmanned Aircraft Systems (drone) company .

His interest in coding began in 2001 when he took his first HTML class and began designing websites for schools in the local area. He believes that coding is an effective strategy for teachers to use in their classrooms because it is not only fun, but it encourages collaboration, problem solving, and helps equip students with the skills they need for the 21st century workforce.

Herman believes computer science instruction should start in the early elementary grades and has spent 30 years working with students in grades K-6.

Nick Weyer has been a teacher for over a decade in southern Indiana.  He began his teaching career by teaching mathematics, but in the past three years, he has added computer science to his teaching assignments.  Nick has worked hard to increase technology usage in his classes by working hard to secure grants to obtain technology equipment, and he believes that technology has undoubtedly aided students in their study of all subjects.  When the opportunity to teach CS arose, Nick was excited and after some training, he began with the Exploring Computer Science course.  Now, in addition to an introductory computer science course, Nick teaches AP Computer Science Principles.  While teaching at Tell City Junior-Senior High School, Nick also coaches girls’ and boys’ tennis and sponsors several clubs.  Nick and his wife Katie have two sons:  Jack, 4 and Ben, 1.  In his free time, Nick enjoys spending time with his family and friends, playing and watching sports, and being outdoors.

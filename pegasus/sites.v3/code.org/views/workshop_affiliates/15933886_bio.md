Kate is not quite sure to what to write for her bio but is going to give it a shot... She has been teaching for almost 10 years as a science teacher teaching just about any class her school asks (Biology, Cell Bio, AP Bio, Earth Science, Chemistry, Geometry, and now AP CSP). She is going into her second year as a facilitator for Code.Org and is moving to being an Instructional Coach at her school as well. She has a passion for equity and education. Her interests include anything outdoors, fitness, and memes.

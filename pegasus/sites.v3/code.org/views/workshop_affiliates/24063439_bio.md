Kelsey Evers has been teaching Innovation in a K-8 setting for two years. Innovation at her school includes introduction to programming, robotics, basic engineering, and 3D printing. Kelsey utilizes both Fundamentals and CSD in her classroom to help her students navigate through all aspects of computer science. Kelsey is a lead learner in her classroom and a team-learner with teachers from all over Northern Colorado. Kelsey loves learning from her peers and constantly changing the way she teaches and the content she teaches based on student needs and the ever changing world of technology. As a facilitator, she's most excited to empower teachers to jump in head first, in whatever capacity they are able, and then supporting them as they grow in their confidence, in not only teaching the curriculum, but as they grow as computer scientists themselves! Kelsey graduated from Colorado Christian University with a Bachelors of Liberal Arts with an emphasis in Elementary Education in 2010. Since then she has been teaching the intermediate grades and technology for the past eight years. In her spare time she enjoys finding joy in the small things including hiking, puzzling, playing with her two dogs, and playing board games with friends.

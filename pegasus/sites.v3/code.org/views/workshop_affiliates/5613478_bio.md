**What teachers say about Shane's workshops**

"This was a highly engaging workshop, and Shane is such a knowledgeable teacher! The hands-on experiences and the collaboration that went on in the class are exactly what all teachers and students should experience in school.

"This was definitely one of the best workshops that I have attended since my time in the DOE. It was exciting, engaging, and very pertinent to our kids future. I wish that more workshops offered were to this caliber. The instructor was fun, entertaining, and knowledgeable, and kept the class moving at a consistent pace. Thank you so much for this opportunity!"

Shane was great! All the hands-on activities were very helpful to prepare to teach them to students. Great opportunity to network with like-minded ed professionals. Wonderful of you to make this a free and accessible event for everyone. Loved the swag too. Much more than I expected."

Education has always been a constant in life for Chris.  Whether it's the nearly 20 years spent in the elementary classroom, professional development with districts, schools, and teachers, to learning life lessons and skills; it has always been a driving force.  Chris loves being a facilitator for Code.org, and looks forward to sharing knowledge, skills, and a love for computer science with other elementary teachers.

## Join Us September 27-28, 2018

The annual State Policy Forum brings together legislators, education officials, state advocates, industry, national organizations, and representatives from state executive offices committed to K-12 computer science education. This year's forum is co-hosted by [Code.org](https://code.org/promote) and the Computer Science Teachers Association ([CSTA](https://www.csteachers.org/)).

The forum is composed of two experiences, a pre-forum for members of the [Code.org Advocacy Coalition](https://advocacy.code.org) immediately followed by a main forum for all participants.

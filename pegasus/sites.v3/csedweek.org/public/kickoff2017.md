# CSEdWeek Kickoff Event

## December 3, 2018 - Seattle, WA

## **Save the Date**

Every year, Code.org kicks off Computer Science Education Week with a signature event – at the White House, opening the stock market, or in Silicon Valley with leading women in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg and Susan Wojcicki.

You’re invited to a special event to launch Computer Science Education Week 2018, to celebrate the accomplishments of the CS education community, and to make new announcements and pledges to K-12 computer science.

## **Pledges and Announcements**

Would you like to help generate positive press for the work your organization is doing to support computer science? We are now [collecting pledges and announcements](https://bit.ly/csedweek2017form) for the CSEdWeek kickoff event. We want to share the spotlight and press attention with you during this event by inviting you to submit a new announcement and/or pledge with a focus on broadening participation in computer science. 

These announcements represent an opportunity to celebrate a recent achievement or the launch of a new initiative. Pledges represent a clear and measurable goal to expand access and diversity in computer science that includes a specific number of teachers, schools, and/or students who will be engaged. Announcements and pledges should be **new** and newsworthy. We won’t repeat information that has been previously shared publicly. Of course, you're welcome to schedule independent announcements for the morning of December 3rd as well.

[Please complete this form](https://bit.ly/csedweek2017form) by **November 2nd** to submit an announcement and/or pledge to be considered for the 2018 CSEdWeek kickoff event. See examples of [pledges and announcements here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YzicRgPnuJzkzxqF06v2NZsXdmZNxSYAKmclRPShf9M).

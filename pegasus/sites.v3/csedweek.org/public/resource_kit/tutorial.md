# Tutorial Guide

Students and teachers will be able to choose among a [variety of one-hour tutorials](/learn) to participate in the Hour of Code. One such tutorial is being developed by Code.org in collaboration with engineers from Google and Microsoft, but many other organizations are developing alternative tutorials. Many tutorials are [available to test out](/learn).

All tutorials will share these factors in common:

- Self-guided lessons require little or no involvement from the teacher. 
- Requires no previous experience on behalf of the student or the teacher.
- Can be completed in one hour or less.

### No prior experience needed. Computers are optional

Different tutorials will have:

- Different age targets. Most will target any age, but some will be more appropriate to younger or older students.
- Different mechanics. Many will involve manipulating visual blocks on the screen, but some will involve typing actual code on the keyboard.
- Different goals. In some the student may be solving puzzles, in others creating art, or even creating an interative holiday card.
- Different technology requirements. Most will run within a browser on a PC, tablet, or smartphone, but some will require software to be installed ahead of time, and others will be fully "unplugged" requiring no computer at all. (see example "unplugged" tutorials: [by NCWIT](http://www.ncwit.org/unplugged) or by [ThinkerSmith](/files/CSEDrobotics.pdf))

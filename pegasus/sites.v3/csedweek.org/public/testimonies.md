title: 'What people are saying about the Hour of Code'

This is our first year participating in The Hour of Code, but students and teachers are already using the tutorials & writing lines of code.  25 first graders wanted to miss recess today so they could stay in the library and continue coding--they even taught our principal what to do!   Kindergartners cheered when they made the angry bird "move forward" to the green pig.    5th graders huddled over computers and wrote over 34 lines of code in minutes.  Most importantly, I saw students engaged, thinking, collaborating, problem solving, persevering & celebrating their accomplishments.

# CSEdWeek Kickoff Event

## December 3, 2018 - Seattle, WA

Every year, Code.org kicks off Computer Science Education Week with a signature event â€“ at the White House, opening the stock market, or in Silicon Valley with leading women in tech, like Sheryl Sandberg, Susan Wojcicki and Peggy Johnson.

In 2018, for the first time, we were thrilled to kick off the global celebration right here in Seattle. We celebrated the accomplishments of the CS education community, made new pledges to K-12 computer science, and heard from Melinda Gates, Co-Chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

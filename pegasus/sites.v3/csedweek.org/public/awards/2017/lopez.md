Two years ago, he established the computer science program at J. W. Nixon High School (99% Hispanic enrollment) and currently serves as the only computer science teacher at Laredo ISD. After starting with just nine students his pilot year, enrollment increased to 40 last year, and 64 in 2017. 75% of his AP CS Principles students passed the course despite many students carrying the "at-risk" and "English language learner" label. After school he offered students unofficial AP CS A lessons, resulting in three students passing the AP exam. He now officially teaches AP CS Principles and AP CS A and has plans to expand the pathway next year to include an advanced data structures course. The Computer Programming Team he coached placed 2nd at the District Competition (Rio Grande Valley) and 3rd Place at the Region Competition (Mid and South Texas), an incredible feat for novices facing veteran teams.

# Diane Neville

### Champion for Computer Science - Broadening Participation Award (Teacher Category)

## Gulfstream Academy of Hallandale Beach (Hallandale Beach, FL)

As a lifelong learner, Diane Neville sought to learn about computer science and was fortunate to find herself in a Code.org classroom. She saw something she had never seen before – cohesive curriculum that spanned the entire spectrum of K-12 learning and beyond. With this empowering tool at her fingertips, Diane set out to create a program of study that met the needs of every student who walked through her classroom door. This experience has been transformational.

The students that Diane teaches have many learning barriers - from learning disabilities to language barriers - but what they all have in common, is they all love to code! Customized course sections have been developed using many diverse options so that every student experiences high levels of success while coding. Each student’s enthusiasm and personal motivation to learn have skyrocketed with this approach. The struggle over homework is long forgotten when students eagerly inquire if they could code at home. At long last, school is fun for these struggling students! What she is teaching in school could very well help these students see their way out of poverty.

Having personally struggled to get a foothold on life, Diane has always been an advocate for the underdog. Throughout her 30 years of teaching she has worked with disadvantaged youth employment programs, welfare to work programs, incarcerated adult males, and dedicated countless hours to local homeless initiatives.

Through presentations to her school's PTA, district colleagues, superintendents, and curriculum leaders, Heather encouraged them to include CS education in the elementary school curriculum. The 2017-18 school year is the first year that this new curriculum took effect; she now teaches computer science on a weekly basis to every student in grades K-6 at her school, a population that is 50% female, 68% students of color, and 54% free/reduced lunch.

But it doesnâ€™t stop there. She volunteers at local conferences to promote the Hour of Code, presents professional learning sessions, and also facilitates Code.org CS Fundamentals workshops. She's an active member of the Connecticut Computer Science Teachers Association and most recently has been working with its members to launch the "S4CT Summit" in spring 2018. As part of her advocacy work, she volunteers on the Connecticut State Department of Education's Computer Science Advisory Group and is part of a workgroup that advises on computer science standards adoption, certification, and training opportunities.

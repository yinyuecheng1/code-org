# Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts (Hot Springs, AR)

### Champion for Computer Science - Advocacy Award (School Category)

The Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences and the Arts (ASMSA) has provided training to nearly half of Arkansas’ newly-certified CS teachers through the Coding Arkansas’ Future initiative. This year, 1,500 students and teachers in communities across the state will benefit from their expertise and support.

As a public-private partnership between the Arkansas Department of Education and collaborators across the nation, ASMSA’s educator development and mentoring model has been highly successful in building capacity within local districts to meet Governor Asa Hutchinson's vision of computer science in every Arkansas high school. The program has worked with nearly 100 educators—both new and experienced—in developing their abilities to teach computer science through a yearlong program. Through the experience, they learn from an ASMSA master teacher who provides course content through blended learning. The school has also worked with the Women’s Foundation of Arkansas to launch #g1rlsc0de enrichment programs and facilitate discussions on equity in access to computer science.

ASMSA provides extraordinary opportunities for a diverse group of students from across the state. Established in 1991 to serve talented and motivated high school juniors and seniors as a school of choice, ASMSA is one of only 16 public, residential high schools in the United States focusing on advanced educational experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Through the nationally ranked residential experience, out of school enrichment programs, and educator development initiatives, ASMSA promotes creativity and innovation while improving learning for all Arkansas students.
